BODY: "The post Cardano Price Targeting $1.50 After Growing Whale Accumulation; The Same Can Be Said For This $0.07 Crypto appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Cardano (ADA) has always played the long game. While flashier projects chased hype cycles, Cardano focused on building slowly, methodically and with purpose. Now, after months of quiet accumulation, the whales are back and the charts are whispering what long-time holders have waited to hear: $1.50 may finally be in sight. But ADA isn’t the only one catching the attention of deep-pocketed investors. Remittix (RTX) , a rising $0.0781 crypto in the PayFi space, is showing eerily similar accumulation patterns, except it’s doing so during its presale. With over $15.1 million raised and a real-world use case centered around instant crypto-to-fiat transfers, some are wondering if RTX is Cardano 2.0 in its early, high-upside days. As the smart money circles both projects, the big question isn’t just about ADA’s breakout; it’s whether Remittix is quietly preparing one of its own. Whales are circling as Cardano eyes $1.50 breakout Cardano’s never been the fastest mover in the crypto world, but it’s often one of the most deliberate. While others rush to market with half-baked promises, Cardano keeps building brick by brick. That patience may finally be paying off, as Cardano’s price targets $1.50, powered by a quiet surge in whale accumulation and solid network fundamentals. ADA monthly price movement. Source: CoinMarketCap As seen in the chart above, over the past month, ADA’s price action has been anything but boring. Starting at $0.6245 in late April, it climbed steadily, peaking near $0.85 on May 10, a 36% rally, before correcting to $0.74. While some see the drop as weakness, others see consolidation and preparation for the next leg up. Supporting this optimism is Cardano’s growing ecosystem. From Hydra, its Layer-2 scaling solution, to Mithril, a stake-based innovation for faster data verification, the tech under the hood is catching up to the platform’s ambitions. DeFi and NFTs continue to gain traction, adding real use cases to the chain. If Bitcoin approaches its $150K forecast, analysts believe altcoins like Cardano could ride the wave, and for ADA, that means a realistic push toward $1.50. The Cardano price may move slowly, but when it rallies, it tends to do so with conviction. Whales don’t swim, they wire. Why Remittix is their next big splash In a market flooded with hype and half-measures, whales are moving with precision and they’re moving toward Remittix. Why? Because Remittix isn’t just another crypto project. It’s a direct shot at the inefficiencies of traditional finance, bridging a $183 trillion banking sector with blockchain in a way that’s fast, cheap and built for the world, not just the privileged few. Source: Youtube While Stripe, Wise and Coinbase dabble in fiat and crypto, Remittix goes all-in on crypto-to-fiat remittances, integrating directly with local payment networks. That means instant or near-instant transactions, no middlemen and transparent fees that put banks to shame. For high-net-worth investors, that’s not just innovative, it’s irresistible. Then there’s the VIP Program. With annual staking rewards as high as 18%, platinum debit cards, and personal account managers, Remittix rewards conviction. The higher your investment, the greater your influence, literally. VIPs gain enhanced governance rights and insider access, making them architects of the ecosystem, not just passengers. Add in the Remittix Wallet; secure, non-custodial and sleekly designed and you’ve got a platform where whales don’t just park capital; they grow it. In a landscape where privacy, speed and control matter more than ever, Remittix is the smart money’s next move. Conclusion Cardano’s path to $1.50 is paved with strong fundamentals and growing whale appetite. Remittix is attracting the same kind of early interest from deep-pocketed investors, thanks to its bold vision for crypto-to-fiat remittances. With a real-world use case, a rewards-rich VIP program and growing momentum, RTX may be carving out a parallel success story. If ADA is the legacy builder, Remittix could be its high-speed, modern counterpart in the making.

BODY: "Global investment giant VanEck has announced that it will launch its Avalanche-focused fund next June. VanEck announced plans to launch its VanEck PurposeBuilt fund in June, focused on investing in Avalanche (AVAX)-based projects. The AVAX-based fund, which will be managed by VanEck’s Digital Assets Alpha Fund, will focus on sectors such as gaming, financial services and artificial intelligence. Pranav Kanade, portfolio manager of VanEck Digital Assets Alpha Fund, said the fund is not looking to chase advertising or short-term trends but is thinking long-term. “The next wave of value in crypto will come not from more infrastructure, but from real businesses. Avalanche has become a magnet for thoughtful builders, and with the VanEck PurposeBuilt Fund, we bring capital and belief to founders, not chasing momentum, but creating enduring value.” Apart from VanEck, Grayscale also has Avalanche Trust, which launched in August 2024. However, Grayscale has filed with the SEC to convert Avalanche Trust into a spot ETF. At this point, institutional interest in Avalanche continues to grow, while Grayscale is still awaiting SEC approval. *This is not investment advice.

BODY: "Key takeaways: The Bitcoin Quantile Model shows “heat” with price on the verge of an “acceleration phase,” echoing Q4 2024 when BTC embarked on a 45% post-election rally. Bitcoin (BTC) price has formed a new intraday high on each daily candle this week, with the crypto asset slowly grinding toward a new all-time high. In line with its current trajectory, 21st Capital co-founder Sina noted that Bitcoin is approaching a pivotal moment around the $108,000 level. The Bitcoin Quantile Model update shows that BTC’s market reflects the same “heat” that was present after President Trump’s post-election rally and the spot ETF-driven highs during Q4 2024. The model, which uses quantile regression to map Bitcoin’s price phases on a logarithmic scale, indicates the cryptocurrency is in the Transition Zone, a critical juncture before the Acceleration Phase. Throughout Q4, 2024, Bitcoin rallied by 45% after entering a price discovery period above $74,500. Bitcoin Quantile Model. Source: X.com As illustrated in the chart, once it breaks into the "Acceleration" Phase, it could trigger BTC’s next leg or the mid-phase, typically between the 33% and 66% range. Based on the model, BTC is expected to progressively target price levels of $130,000 and $163,000 in the coming months. However, anonymous Bitcoin analyst apsk32 believed a price target above $200,000 is a “reasonable” expectation for 2025. Basing the projection on Bitcoin’s “power curve,” the analyst noted that BTC’s position relative to gold has significantly improved since April. From a technical standpoint, this view is supported by the recent convergence of the Sharpe ratios for Bitcoin and gold, suggesting that the two hard assets now offer comparable risk-to-reward profiles to their investors. Fidelity’s Director of Global Macro Jurrien Timmer shed light on this development, recommending a 4:1 goal-to-Bitcoin ratio from an allocation perspective. Related: Bitcoin 'blow-off top' set at $128K with new all-time highs in sight Strong Bitcoin volumes “final straw” before new highs Crypto researcher Aylo analyzed BTC’s historical price action when the crypto asset consolidates near its all-time high level. In an X post, the analyst explained, “The data shows when BTC gets close to its previous ATH during a strong, accelerating trend with high momentum, it has historically broken out to new ATHs within a short time (days to weeks).” However, weaker trends have led to stalls or retraces between March and May 2024. Currently, Bitcoin exhibits a strong trend but lacks the necessary trading volume, which remains the final straw to confirm a breakout, a factor that could delay upward movement. Alyo added that for Bitcoin to break its all-time highs, daily trading volume should exceed the previous 10 days, be at least 1.5 times the 20-day average, and ideally sustain a 3-day increase while the price holds steady or rises. Data from CryptoQuant has reinforced Aylo’s concerns about trading volume. On May 21, retail investor demand for Bitcoin, defined as wallets buying/selling between $0 and $10,000, remained low at just 3.2% over 30 days, despite BTC trading within $2,000 of its all-time high.
