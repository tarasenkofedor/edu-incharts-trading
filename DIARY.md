## InChart Project Overview (MVP)

**Overall Goal:** Build an MVP for "InChart," a trading platform. A key requirement was to use a local, "raw" version of `trading-vue-js` rather than installing it from npm.

**Core Technologies:**
*   **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), PostgreSQL, Alembic (migrations), JWT (authentication), Redis.
*   **Frontend:** Vue 2, Vuex, Axios. Local `trading-vue-js` library.
*   **Data:** OHLCV and Signal data via CSV uploads. News data via Marketaux API.

**Key Features & Functionality:**

1.  **Backend Setup (FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Alembic, Redis):**
    *   **User Management:**
        *   Registration (`/auth/register`) with nickname, email, password.
        *   Login (`/auth/login`) with nickname or email, returning JWT.
        *   Password hashing using `bcrypt`.
        *   `User` model in PostgreSQL with fields like `id`, `nickname`, `email`, `hashed_password`, `subscription_plan` (ENUM: FREE, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE), `is_active`.
        *   Alembic for database schema migrations.
    *   **Data Endpoints:**
        *   `/users/me`: Protected endpoint to fetch authenticated user details.
        *   `/data/upload_csv`: Endpoint to upload OHLCV CSV files.
            *   Validates CSV format (columns: `timestamp,open,high,low,close,volume`).
            *   Ensures data types, timestamp order, and millisecond epoch timestamps.
            *   Uses `pandas` for CSV processing.
        *   `/api/news/{symbol}`: Fetches news articles for a given symbol, processed by `news_fetcher_service`.
    *   **Middleware:**
        *   CORS configured for `http://localhost:8080`.
        *   JWT authentication dependencies for protected routes.

2.  **Frontend Setup (Vue 2, Vuex, Local `trading-vue-js`):**
    *   **Core Structure:**
        *   Vue 2 project in `frontend/`.
        *   `axios` for HTTP requests.
        *   `vuex@3` for state management.
        *   Local `trading-vue-js` source code integrated into `frontend/src/trading-vue-core/`.
    *   **Vuex Store (`frontend/src/store/`):**
        *   `auth` module: Handles login, registration, user state, token management (including `localStorage`), and auto-login.
        *   `chart` module: Manages chart data, primarily the `DataCube` instance from `trading-vue-js`.
        *   `news` module: Manages news articles, loading state, and errors for the `NewsPanel`.
    *   **Views & Components (`frontend/src/views/`, `frontend/src/components/`):**
        *   `App.vue`: Main application component with router view and navigation.
        *   `Home.vue`: Main view displaying the chart, OHLCV uploader, and signal uploader.
        *   `Login.vue` & `Register.vue`: Views for user authentication.
        *   `CsvUpload.vue`: Component for uploading OHLCV CSV files.
        *   `SignalUpload.vue`: Component for uploading signal CSV files.
        *   `TradingVue.vue` (from local `trading-vue-core`): The core charting library component.
        *   `NewsPanel.vue`: Component to display news articles, fetched via Vuex `news` module.
    *   **Routing (`frontend/src/router/index.js`):**
        *   Vue Router with history mode.
        *   Navigation guards for route protection (`requiresAuth` for authenticated routes like Home, `guest` for unauthenticated routes like Login/Register).
    *   **Styling & Linting:**
        *   Basic CSS for components.
        *   ESLint with Prettier for code formatting (ongoing fixes).

3.  **Charting Functionality:**
    *   **Initial Display:** Chart loads with default OHLCV data (`frontend/src/assets/data.json`) and a sample EMA overlay.
    *   **OHLCV Upload:** Users can upload CSV files with OHLCV data.
        *   Client-side header validation (`timestamp,open,high,low,close,volume`).
        *   Backend validation and processing.
        *   Chart updates reactively to display new OHLCV data.
    *   **Signal Data Upload & Display:** Users can upload CSV files with signal data.
        *   Client-side header validation (`timestamp,type,price`).
        *   Expected CSV columns: `timestamp,type,price,label,color,icon`.
        *   Signals are parsed and transformed into "Trades" overlay format for `trading-vue-js`.
        *   Chart updates reactively to display signals alongside OHLCV data.
    *   **`DataCube` (`trading-vue-js`):** Central class for managing chart data (OHLCV, on-chart overlays, off-chart overlays).
    *   **Chart Interaction:** Zoom (mouse scroll) and crosshair functionality.

4.  **News Feature:**
    *   **Backend (`news_fetcher_service`, API):**
        *   Standalone service (`backend/news_fetcher_service/main.py`) polls Marketaux API for news articles based on symbols (e.g., BTCUSDT).
        *   Fetched articles (headline, snippet, image URL, published date, sentiment) are stored in `news_articles` PostgreSQL table.
        *   API endpoint (`/api/news/{symbol}`) in `backend/app/routers/news.py` serves these articles.
    *   **Frontend (`NewsPanel.vue`, Vuex `news` module):
        *   "News" button in `Home.vue` (visible for authenticated users) toggles `NewsPanel.vue`.
        *   `NewsPanel.vue` fetches and displays news for the currently selected symbol (e.g., BTCUSDT from live chart, or a default).
        *   Uses Vuex `news` module for state management (articles, loading status, errors).
        *   Articles are cleared from store when panel is closed.
        *   Article images are clickable links.

**Development & Debugging Log (Key Points):**

*   **Alembic Migrations:** Significant debugging to correctly set up initial `users` table migration, especially with PostgreSQL ENUM types.
*   **Import Issues:** Resolved `ModuleNotFoundError` in backend by switching to relative imports.
*   **Pydantic V2 Compatibility:** Updated `orm_mode` to `from_attributes`.
*   **Routing Fixes:** Corrected 404s due to router prefix issues.
*   **Chart Data Flow (Major Debugging):**
    *   Ensured `DataCube` reactivity and forced re-rendering on data changes.
    *   Fixed timestamp interpretation in backend for OHLCV uploads (`unit='ms'`).
    *   Corrected data propagation from `DataCube` to `Chart.vue` (via `TradingVue.vue`'s `decubed` property and `dc_core.js` `init_data` logic).
    *   Resolved issues with `Chart.vue` not finding OHLCV or signal data in the `DataCube` instance it received.
*   **Crosshair Performance:** Optimized by throttling `updater.sync()` calls in `Chart.vue` using `requestAnimationFrame`.
*   **Signal Parsing:** Fixed newline character handling in `SignalUpload.vue` (`split(/\r?\n/)` -> `split('\n')`).
*   **Uploader UX:** Standardized styling, error messages, and client-side validation flow for both `CsvUpload.vue` and `SignalUpload.vue`.
*   **ESLint:** Ongoing fixes for formatting and linting rules.
*   **Performance Optimization (`Trades.vue`):** Significantly improved rendering performance of signal overlays in `frontend/src/trading-vue-core/components/overlays/Trades.vue`.
    *   Implemented horizontal culling: Markers are only drawn if their screen X-coordinate falls within the visible canvas width (plus a small buffer).
    *   Implemented zoom-dependent label rendering: Signal labels are only drawn if the current candle width in pixels (`layout.px_step`) exceeds a configurable threshold (e.g., 5px). This prevents rendering numerous overlapping labels when zoomed out.
*   **News Feature Implementation & Debugging:**
    *   **Backend:**
        *   Created `news_articles` table and Alembic migration.
        *   Developed `news_fetcher_service` to poll Marketaux API and save data.
        *   Implemented `/api/news/{symbol}` endpoint in `backend/app/routers/news.py`.
        *   Fixed 404 error on news API due to incorrect router prefix in `main.py`.
        *   Added `MARKETAUX_API_TOKEN` to Pydantic `Settings` in `config.py` for the fetcher service.
        *   Ensured `sort=published_on` parameter used for Marketaux API for recent news.
    *   **Frontend (Vuex `news` module & `NewsPanel.vue`):
        *   Created Vuex `news` module (`frontend/src/store/modules/news.js`) for state (newsArticles, isNewsLoading, newsError) and actions (fetchNewsForSymbol, clearNews).
        *   Refactored `NewsPanel.vue` to use the Vuex module.
        *   Implemented image clickability and news clearing on panel close.
        *   **Critical Fix (Display Issue):** Resolved issue where `NewsPanel.vue` showed "No news available" despite data being fetched. The root cause was an inconsistency in the Vuex `news` module state property naming. The `state` object used `articles`, while mutations (`SET_NEWS_ARTICLES`, `CLEAR_NEWS`) and `mapState` in the component expected `newsArticles`. Corrected `state` to use `newsArticles` and updated the corresponding getter, ensuring reactive updates flowed to the component.
        *   Addressed various linter errors and logging improvements during debugging.

**Persistent Minor Issues (Monitored):**
*   Non-critical `passlib`/`bcrypt` version introspection warning in backend logs.
*   Persistent "No Babel config file detected" ESLint warning in frontend (considered an environment/editor issue).

This overview provides a snapshot of the project's current state and the journey to get here. It will be updated as new features are developed and significant changes occur.

### Action: Start Task 2.0 - Core Charting Shell (Vue.js & Local `trading-vue-js` Code)
- **Status:** `done`
- **Result:** Parent Task 1.0 completed. Foundational work for frontend charting (Tasks 2.1-2.5) is now complete.
- **Next:** Proceed with Task 3.0: Custom Price Data (OHLCV) Upload & Display.

### Action: Task 2.1 - Vue.js Project Setup & Component Identification
- **Status:** `done`
- **Result:** 
    - Vue 2 project initialized in `frontend/`.
    - `axios` and `vuex@3` installed.
    - `frontend/src/trading-vue-core/` created.
    - User instructed to move local `trading-vue-js` source files into `frontend/src/trading-vue-core/` and docs into `frontend/public/docs_trading_vue_local/` (assumed complete based on user directive to investigate these folders).
    - Investigated `frontend/dist_trading_vue_local/` and concluded it's likely not needed.
    - Identified `TradingVue.vue` from `frontend/src/trading-vue-core/` as the main charting component.
- **Next:** Proceed with Task 2.2: Basic Charting Component Integration.

### Action: Task 2.2 - Basic Charting Component Integration
- **Status:** `done`
- **Result:**
    - Created `frontend/src/assets/data.json` with minimal sample data for the chart.
    - Modified `frontend/src/views/Home.vue` to import and display the `TradingVue.vue` component from `frontend/src/trading-vue-core/TradingVue.vue`.
    - The `Home.vue` component now imports `DataCube` from `frontend/src/trading-vue-core/helpers/datacube.js` and uses it with the sample data.
    - Noted a linter error regarding Babel config, but `babel.config.js` appears correct; proceeding as it might be an editor/linter-specific issue.
- **Next:** Proceed with Task 2.3: Asset/Timeframe UI Component (Static).

### Action: Task 2.3 - Asset/Timeframe UI Component (Static)
- **Status:** `done`
- **Result:**
    - Modified `frontend/src/views/Home.vue` to include a static UI element in the top-left corner for asset and timeframe selection.
    - The selector contains placeholders for "Asset: BTCUSD" and "Timeframe: 1H".
    - Styled the component with a minimalistic, Apple-like design (light background, rounded corners, subtle text, box shadow).
    - The persistent Babel linter error is noted but considered an environment issue for now.
- **Next:** Proceed with Task 2.4: Fix Chart Zoom Functionality.

### Action: Task 2.4 - Chart Zoom Functionality Investigation & Fix
- **Status:** `done`
- **Issue:** Chart zoom-out functionality was not working as expected when using a mouse/trackpad scroll on macOS (physical scroll down, interpreted as scroll up by macOS, should zoom out the chart). Zoom-in was working.
- **Troubleshooting Steps:**
    - Temporarily removed custom UI elements (`asset-timeframe-selector`) from `Home.vue` to isolate the chart.
    - Added `wheel` event listeners to `Home.vue` to confirm scroll direction detection by the browser/Vue component. Confirmed correct detection of scroll up/down intentions.
    - Added detailed console logging inside the `mousezoom` function in `frontend/src/trading-vue-core/components/js/grid.js` to inspect `delta` values, `MIN_ZOOM`, `MAX_ZOOM`, and `this.data.length`.
    - Analyzed logs: Revealed that the zoom-out action (negative `delta` in `grid.js`) was correctly triggered but blocked by the `minZoomCheck` condition: `delta < 0 && this.data.length <= this.MIN_ZOOM`.
    - The sample data (`frontend/src/assets/data.json`) had only 5 data points (`this.data.length = 5`). The default `MIN_ZOOM` was 25.
- **Resolution:** 
    - Modified `frontend/src/trading-vue-core/components/js/grid.js` to set `this.MIN_ZOOM = 1;` in the constructor. This allows zooming out even with very small datasets.
    - Confirmed with the user that both zoom-in and zoom-out functionalities are now working correctly.
    - Cleaned up debug `console.log` statements from `grid.js`.
    - Restored the `asset-timeframe-selector` UI in `Home.vue` and removed temporary wheel event listeners.
- **Key Takeaway:** The `MIN_ZOOM` setting in `trading-vue-core` is critical for zoom behavior, especially with small datasets. If `data.length` is less than or equal to `MIN_ZOOM`, zoom-out will be disabled. This was the root cause of the perceived "zoom not working" issue.
- **Next:** Update `TASKS.md` to reflect resolution of 2.4 and remove the task. Proceed with next task.

### Action: Task 2.5 - Store Chart Data in Vuex
- **Status:** `done`
- **Result:**
    - Created `frontend/src/store/index.js` for the main Vuex store setup.
    - Created `frontend/src/store/modules/chart.js` with state for `rawChartData` and `chartDataCube`, a `SET_CHART_DATA` mutation, a `loadChartData` action (currently loads static `SampleData`), and getters for the chart data.
    - Updated `frontend/src/main.js` to import and use the Vuex store (user confirmed manual update).
    - Refactored `frontend/src/views/Home.vue` to use `mapGetters` to get `chartDataCube` from the Vuex store (`chart/getChartDataCube`) and `mapActions` to dispatch `chart/loadInitialChartData` in the `mounted` hook.
- **Next:** All sub-tasks for 2.0 are complete. Update `TASKS.md` to mark parent Task 2.0 as `done`. Proceed to Task 3.0.

### Action: Task 3.1 - Frontend Price Data Upload UI
- **Status:** `done`
- **Result:**
    - Created `frontend/src/components/CsvUpload.vue` with a file input, upload button, and basic styling.
    - Integrated `CsvUpload.vue` into `frontend/src/views/Home.vue`, placing it above the chart area.
    - Adjusted layout in `Home.vue` to a flex column and updated chart resize handling.
- **Next:** Proceed with Task 3.2: Backend API Endpoint for Price Data Upload.

### Action: Task 3.2 - Backend API Endpoint for Price Data Upload
- **Status:** `done`
- **Result:**
    - Created `backend/app/routers/data.py` with an `/upload_csv` endpoint.
    - Endpoint expects a CSV file, validates for `.csv` extension.
    - Uses `pandas` to read the CSV.
    - Validates for required columns: `timestamp,open,high,low,close,volume`.
    - Validates numeric data types for OHLCV columns.
    - Converts `timestamp` column to datetime objects and ensures they are sorted ascending.
    - Converts timestamps to milliseconds since epoch.
    - Returns a JSON response with filename, message, row count, column names, and the processed `chartData` as a list of lists.
    - Included the new data router in `backend/app/main.py`.
- **Next:** Proceed with Task 3.3: Chart Population with Custom Price Data.

### Action: Task 3.3 - Chart Population with Custom Price Data
- **Status:** `done`
- **Result:**
    - Updated `frontend/src/components/CsvUpload.vue` to emit `file-upload-initiated`, manage `isLoading` state, and show feedback.
    - Updated `frontend/src/views/Home.vue` to handle `file-upload-initiated`, use `axios` to POST file to `/data/upload_csv`, and call Vuex action `chart/setUploadedChartData` on success. Added `ref` to `CsvUpload` to update its status.
    - Updated `frontend/src/store/modules/chart.js` with `setUploadedChartData` action and modified `SET_CHART_DATA` mutation to handle `{data, type}` payload for `DataCube`.
    - Corrected `Home.vue` to dispatch `loadInitialChartData`.
- **Next:** All sub-tasks for Task 3.0 (Custom Price Data OHLCV) are complete. Update `TASKS.md` to mark Task 3.0 as `done`. Proceed to Task 3.5 (User Authentication UI & Nickname Integration) as requested by user to skip 4.0 for now.

### Action: Task 3.5.1 - Login Component & Basic Auth Flow
- **Status:** `done`
- **Result:**
    - Updated `frontend/src/views/Login.vue`:
        - Implemented `handleLogin` method to dispatch `auth/login` Vuex action.
        - Handles form submission, loading states, and displays errors from Vuex store.
        - Redirects to `/` on successful login.
    - Updated `frontend/src/App.vue`:
        - Added a navigation bar showing Login/Logout links based on authentication status.
        - Displays logged-in user's nickname (fetched from `/users/me` via Vuex).
        - Implemented `handleLogout` method to dispatch `auth/logout` Vuex action and redirect to `/login`.
        - Removed placeholder `created()` hook for session restoration.
    - Updated `frontend/src/store/modules/auth.js`:
        - Corrected `localStorage` key to `user-token`.
        - `login` action now dispatches `fetchCurrentUser` after successful token retrieval.
        - Added `fetchCurrentUser` action: calls backend `/users/me` endpoint, commits `AUTH_SUCCESS` with token and full user data, or `AUTH_ERROR` on failure.
        - Added `tryAutoLogin` action: checks `localStorage` for `user-token`, if found, sets Axios header and dispatches `fetchCurrentUser` to restore session.
        - `AUTH_ERROR` mutation now clears `state.token` and `state.user`.
    - Updated `frontend/src/main.js`:
        - Dispatches `auth/tryAutoLogin` action before Vue app is mounted to attempt session restoration.
    - Updated `frontend/src/router/index.js`:
        - Added `meta: { requiresAuth: true }` to the home route (`/`).
        - Added `meta: { guest: true }` to the login route (`/login`).
        - Implemented `router.beforeEach` global navigation guard:
            - Redirects unauthenticated users to `/login` if trying to access routes with `requiresAuth`.
            - Redirects authenticated users to `/` (home) if trying to access routes with `guest` (like `/login`).
        - Enabled `history` mode for the router.
- **Next:** Update `TASKS.md`. Proceed with Task 3.5.2: Registration Component & Functionality.

### Action: Task 3.5.2 - Registration Component & Functionality
- **Status:** `done`
- **Result:**
    - Created `frontend/src/views/Register.vue`:
        - Form for `nickname`, `email`, `password`, and `confirmPassword`.
        - Basic client-side validation (password match).
        - `handleRegister` method dispatches `auth/register` Vuex action, then `auth/login` for auto-login upon successful registration.
        - Redirects to `/` on successful login.
        - Displays error messages from Vuex store or local validation.
    - Updated `frontend/src/router/index.js`:
        - Added route `/register` pointing to `RegisterView`.
        - Marked `/register` route with `meta: { guest: true }` to restrict access for logged-in users.
    - Updated `frontend/src/store/modules/auth.js`:
        - Added `register` action: 
            - Commits `AUTH_REQUEST`.
            - POSTs to backend `/auth/register` with `nickname`, `email`, `password`.
            - On backend success, returns user data (does not commit `AUTH_SUCCESS` as `login` action follows).
            - On failure, commits `AUTH_ERROR`, clears token/header, and re-throws error.
- **Next:** Update `TASKS.md`. All parts of Task 3.5 are now complete. Confirm next steps with user (likely Task 4.0 or other priorities).

### Action: Testing Authentication Features (Task 3.5)
- **Status:** `in progress`
- **Result:** Provided user with commands to run backend and frontend servers for testing the completed login and registration flows.
  - Backend command: `cd backend && ../.venv/bin/uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
  - Frontend command: `cd frontend && npm run serve`
*   **2025-05-18:**
    *   Successfully installed `axios` and `vuex@3` in the `frontend/` directory using `npm install axios vuex@3`.
    *   Created `frontend/src/trading-vue-core/` directory to house the local `trading-vue-js` source code.
    *   Instructed user to move contents of `frontend/src_trading_vue_local/` to `frontend/src/trading-vue-core/`.
    *   Instructed user to move `frontend/docs_trading_vue_local/` to `frontend/public/docs_trading_vue_local/`.
    *   Requested clarification on the role and necessity of `frontend/dist_trading_vue_local/`.
    *   Investigated `frontend/dist_trading_vue_local/`: Found it contains bundled JS files (minified and unminified) and source maps, not raw assets like images or fonts. Concluded these are built outputs and likely not needed directly when using the source code from `frontend/src/trading-vue-core/`.
    *   **Next:** User to confirm movement of `src_trading_vue_local` and `docs_trading_vue_local` contents. Then, identify the main export/component from `frontend/src/trading-vue-core/` to proceed with Task 2.2 (Basic Charting Component Integration). 

### Action: Fixing Backend and Frontend Startup Errors (During Testing - Task 3.5)
- **Status:** `done`
- **Result:** Addressed errors encountered during initial testing attempts:
    - **Backend (`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'backend'`):** 
        - Modified `backend/app/main.py` to use relative imports for routers (e.g., `from .routers import auth` instead of `from backend.app.routers import auth`).
    - **Frontend (ESLint/Prettier compilation errors):**
        - Ran `npm run lint -- --fix` in the `frontend` directory to automatically correct most formatting issues.
        - Added `// eslint-disable-next-line no-unused-vars` above the `store` import in `frontend/src/router/index.js` to resolve the final `no-unused-vars` linting error.
        - Confirmed `npm run lint` now passes successfully.
- **Next:** User to re-attempt running backend and frontend servers and proceed with testing authentication features. 

### Action: Debugging Charting Functionality - Initial Load & CSV Upload (Tasks 2.0 & 3.0 Related)
- **Status:** `in progress`
- **Overall Goal:** Ensure the chart correctly displays initial sample data and subsequently displays user-uploaded OHLCV CSV data without visual glitches (e.g., candle gaps, incorrect x-axis timestamps).
- **Key Components Involved:**
    - `frontend/src/views/Home.vue`: Main view for displaying the chart and upload component.
    - `frontend/src/components/CsvUpload.vue`: Handles CSV file input and upload.
    - `frontend/src/store/modules/chart.js`: Vuex module for chart data state (`DataCube` instance).
    - `frontend/src/trading-vue-core/TradingVue.vue`: The main charting library component.
    - `frontend/src/trading-vue-core/components/Chart.vue`: The core component rendering the candles and grid.
    - `frontend/src/trading-vue-core/helpers/DataCube.js`: Class for managing chart data.
    - `frontend/src/trading-vue-core/helpers/dc_core.js`: Core logic for `DataCube` data processing.
    - `frontend/src/trading-vue-core/components/js/grid_maker.js`: Logic for creating the chart grid and time axis.

- **Initial Problem (Post CSV Upload):**
    - Chart appeared blank or only showed data after panning.
    - X-axis displayed incorrect timestamps (e.g., 1970 or mismatching the uploaded data's year).
    - Visual gaps between candles.
    - Sample data (Feb 2019) displayed correctly on initial load.

- **Debugging Steps & Fixes So Far:**
    1.  **Vuex & `DataCube` Re-instantiation:** Ensured `SET_CHART_DATA` mutation in Vuex creates a *new* `DataCube` instance when new CSV data is loaded. This was crucial for reactivity.
    2.  **Forced Re-rendering (`chartResetKey`):** Introduced a `chartResetKey` in `Home.vue`, passed down to `TradingVue.vue` and then to its internal `<chart :key="chartResetKey">`. Incrementing this key after data updates forces the `Chart.vue` component to re-render, which helped with update propagation.
    3.  **Chart Range (`setRange`):** Called `this.$refs.tradingVue.setRange(firstTimestamp, lastTimestamp)` in `Home.vue` (wrapped in `$nextTick`) after new data was set in Vuex. This fixed the initially blank chart after upload, but timestamp/gap issues remained.
    4.  **Deep Dive into `DataCube` & `Chart.vue` Data Flow:**
        - Added extensive `console.log` statements in `DataCube.js`, `dc_core.js`, `Chart.vue`, `TradingVue.vue`, and `GridMaker.js`.
        - **Problem Identified (Initial Load):** `Chart.vue`'s `get_ohlcv_from_data_cube` method was unable to find the OHLCV data array on the `DataCube` instance it received during the initial load. Logs showed `dataCubeInstance.ohlcv` and `dataCubeInstance.data.chart.data` were both undefined *from Chart.vue's perspective*.
        - **Root Cause Analysis (`dc_core.js` & `DataCube` `init_data` calls):
            - `DataCube` constructor calls `this.init_data()` (from `DCCore.js`). This correctly populates an *instance property* `this.ohlcv` on the `DataCube` and deletes `this.data.chart.data` (from the raw input data object).
            - `TradingVue.vue`'s `created()` hook calls `this.data.init_tvjs(this)` on the `DataCube` instance. `init_tvjs` then calls `this.init_data(this.tv)` again.
            - **Initial Bug:** The second `init_data` call was inadvertently clearing the instance `this.ohlcv` because it was trying to re-initialize it from `this.data.chart.data` (which was already deleted).
            - **Fix in `dc_core.js`:** Modified `init_data` to only populate the instance `this.ohlcv` from `this.data.chart.data` or `this.data.ohlcv` *if* the instance `this.ohlcv` was not already populated. This preserved the correctly initialized data through both calls.
        - **Problem Identified (Data Prop to `Chart.vue`):
            - `TradingVue.vue` was passing `this.decubed` as the `data` prop to `Chart.vue`.
            - The `decubed` computed property was returning `DataCube_instance.data` (the raw input object, now with its `chart.data` array missing) instead of the `DataCube` instance itself.
            - **Fix in `TradingVue.vue`:** Modified `decubed` to return `this.$props.data` (the `DataCube` instance itself). This ensures `Chart.vue` receives the actual `DataCube` object, allowing its `get_ohlcv_from_data_cube` to find `dataCubeInstance.ohlcv`.

- **Current State (as of last update by user Fyodor):
    - The fixes to `dc_core.js` and `TradingVue.vue` (specifically the `decubed` property) have resolved the initial chart loading issue. The sample data now displays correctly.
    - CSV data upload now loads data onto the chart without needing additional panning.
    - **Persistent Issues:** The primary problems of candle gaps and incorrect x-axis timestamps (e.g., showing 1970 or an incorrect year for 2025 data) *after a CSV upload* still remain.

- **Next Steps in Debugging (Focusing on Gaps & Timestamps post-CSV):**
    - Re-examine timestamp handling from backend to frontend, specifically in `Home.vue`'s `initiateUpload` where raw timestamps are processed.
    - Analyze `Chart.vue`'s `subset()` and `update_layout()` methods, and how `GridMaker.js` uses the `sub` (subset of OHLCV) and `range` to calculate grid lines and labels, especially concerning the `interval` detection/calculation.
    - Investigate if `indexBased` (`ib`) mode is being unintentionally activated or if time-based calculations are flawed with the new data. 

### Action: Charting Functionality - Timestamp & Initial Display FIXED (Task 3.0)
- **Status:** `done` (for timestamp and initial display issues)
- **Summary of Fixes for Timestamp/Display Issue:**
    - **Backend (`backend/app/routers/data.py`):** Modified the `/data/upload_csv` endpoint to correctly parse timestamps from the CSV. Crucially, ensured that if timestamps are numeric, they are interpreted as **milliseconds** using `pd.to_datetime(df['timestamp'], unit='ms')`. This resolved the issue where timestamps were being misinterpreted as 1970 dates.
    - **Frontend (`frontend/src/trading-vue-core/TradingVue.vue`):** Corrected the `decubed` computed property to pass the entire `DataCube` instance to the `Chart.vue` component, rather than its internal (and modified) `data` object. This ensures `Chart.vue` received the `DataCube` with its `ohlcv` property correctly populated.
    - **Frontend (`frontend/src/trading-vue-core/helpers/dc_core.js`):** Refined the `init_data` method to prevent the second call (from `init_tvjs`) from unintentionally clearing the `this.ohlcv` instance property that was correctly set by the first call (from `DataCube` constructor).
- **Result:**
    - CSV uploaded data now displays with correct timestamps on the x-axis.
    - Initial chart display (sample data) and subsequent display of uploaded CSV data are working correctly without requiring panning to show data.
- **Cleanup:**
    - Removed extensive `console.log` statements from `Home.vue`, `dc_core.js`, `DataCube.js`, `TradingVue.vue`, `Chart.vue`, and `grid_maker.js` to improve performance and reduce console noise.
- **Remaining Potential Issue:** User mentioned the chart might still be "a bit laggy." Further performance optimization might be needed if this persists, but log removal is the first step.
- **Next:** Update `TASKS.md`. Monitor for any further lagginess. Proceed with next high-priority tasks. 

### Action: Optimize Chart Crosshair Performance (Addressing Lag)
- **Status:** `done`
- **Issue:** User reported that the chart crosshair (the vertical and horizontal lines following the mouse cursor) was lagging when the mouse was moved quickly around the chart.
- **Analysis of Cause:**
    1.  **Event Frequency:** Mouse move events (`cursor-changed`) were firing very rapidly.
    2.  **Expensive Operations on Each Event:** The `Chart.vue` component was calling `this.updater.sync(e)` (from `CursorUpdater.js`) on every `cursor-changed` event.
    3.  **`CursorUpdater.sync()` Bottlenecks:** This method performed several computationally intensive tasks:
        - It iterated through all chart grids.
        - For each grid, in `cursor_data()`:
            - It mapped all visible OHLCV data points (`this.comp.main_section.sub`) to screen X-coordinates using `data.map((x) => grid.t2screen(x[0]) + 0.5)`. This is O(N) for the visible subset.
            - It called `Utils.nearest_a()` to find the nearest OHLCV data point. `Utils.nearest_a` was implemented as a linear scan (O(N)).
        - In `overlay_data()` (called by `cursor_data()`):
            - It iterated through all overlays.
            - For each overlay, it mapped all of *its* data points to timestamps (`d.data.map((x) => x[0])`). This is another O(M) per overlay.
            - It called `Utils.nearest_a()` (linear scan) for each overlay.
    4.  **Reactive Updates & Redraws:** After these calculations, `updater.sync()` updated reactive properties on `Chart.vue`'s `cursor` object (`this.comp.$set(this.cursor.values, ...)`), which in turn triggered a watcher in `Grid.vue`. This watcher then called `this.redraw()`, causing the entire grid section (including the crosshair) to be redrawn.
    5.  **Combined Effect:** The sequence of (multiple maps + multiple linear scans + reactive updates + full redraw) was happening at the raw, high frequency of mouse move events, overloading the browser's main thread and causing the visual lag of the crosshair.

- **Solution Implemented:**
    1.  **Introduced `throttleRAF` Utility:** A new utility function, `throttleRAF`, was added to `frontend/src/trading-vue-core/stuff/utils.js`. This function uses `window.requestAnimationFrame()` to limit the execution of a given function to once per browser repaint cycle (typically ~60fps).
        ```javascript
        // In Utils.js (simplified representation)
        throttleRAF: (func) => {
          let ticking = false;
          let lastArgs = null;
          let lastContext = null;
          return function(...args) {
            lastArgs = args;
            lastContext = this;
            if (!ticking) {
              window.requestAnimationFrame(() => {
                func.apply(lastContext, lastArgs);
                ticking = false;
              });
              ticking = true;
            }
          };
        }
        ```
    2.  **Applied Throttling in `Chart.vue`:** The `cursor_changed` method in `frontend/src/trading-vue-core/components/Chart.vue` was modified:
        - In `created()`: `this.throttledUpdaterSync = Utils.throttleRAF(this.updater.sync.bind(this.updater));`
        - The direct call `this.updater.sync(e)` was replaced with `this.throttledUpdaterSync(e)`.

- **Why This Improved Performance:**
    - By throttling `updater.sync` with `requestAnimationFrame`, the expensive data calculations and the subsequent reactive updates/redraws are now synchronized with the browser's repaint cycle.
    - Instead of potentially hundreds of updates per second, these operations now run at a more controlled rate (e.g., ~60 updates per second).
    - This significantly reduces the load on the main thread, allowing the browser to render the crosshair (and other UI elements) much more smoothly.

- **Potential Downsides & Future Considerations:**
    - **Minor Latency:** Throttling introduces a very small delay (usually <16ms), which is generally imperceptible for mouse movements.
    - **Underlying Complexity:** The O(N) complexity of `Utils.nearest_a()` (linear scan) and the multiple `map` operations within `updater.sync` remain. If datasets become extremely large, these could still become a bottleneck even when throttled. Future optimization could involve replacing `nearest_a` with a binary search if data is sorted.

- **Result:** User confirmed a significant improvement in crosshair responsiveness and reduction in lag.
- **Next:** Address user registration 404 error. 

### Minor Issue: Passlib/Bcrypt Version Introspection Warning
- **Status:** `monitoring`
- **Symptom:** After successful login (`POST /auth/login` 200 OK) and user fetch (`GET /users/me` 200 OK), a traceback appears in the backend logs:
  ```
  (trapped) error reading bcrypt version
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File ".../passlib/handlers/bcrypt.py", line 620, in _load_backend_mixin
      version = _bcrypt.__about__.__version__
    AttributeError: module 'bcrypt' has no attribute '__about__'
  ```
- **Analysis:** 
    - This warning originates from `passlib` (v1.7.4) when it attempts to determine the version of the installed `bcrypt` library (v4.3.0).
    - The `bcrypt` library (v4.3.0) does not expose its version via an `__about__.__version__` attribute as `passlib` expects in this specific introspection path.
    - `passlib` gracefully traps this error (as indicated by "(trapped)") and continues to function correctly for password hashing and verification.
    - Both `passlib` and `bcrypt` are at the latest versions resolvable by pip based on `requirements.txt` (which specifies `passlib[bcrypt]` without version pins).
- **Impact:** Non-critical. Authentication and user-related operations are successful. The warning is considered noisy but does not affect application functionality.
- **Resolution/Next Steps:** Monitor the situation. If no functional issues arise, the warning will be tolerated. If it becomes problematic, further investigation into specific version pinning or `passlib` issue trackers may be considered.
- **Note:** `pip` was updated to v25.1.1 in the backend virtual environment; this is unrelated to the `passlib` warning but good practice. 

### Action: Task 4.0 - Custom Signal Data Upload & Display
- **Status:** `done`
- **Goal:** Implement functionality to upload custom signal data from a CSV file and display these signals as "Trades" overlays on the chart.
- **Key Implementation Steps & Fixes:**
    1.  **Frontend UI (`SignalUpload.vue`):**
        - Created a new component `frontend/src/components/SignalUpload.vue` with a file input for CSVs.
        - Integrated this component into `frontend/src/views/Home.vue`.
    2.  **CSV Parsing (`SignalUpload.vue`):**
        - Implemented `parseSignalCsv` method to read the signal CSV (expected columns: `timestamp,type,price,label,color,icon`).
        - Transformed parsed rows into the "Trades" overlay format: `{ type: "Trades", data: [[timestamp, numericType, price, label]], settings: { color, iconName, ... } }`.
        - **Fix:** Modified CSV line splitting from `text.split('\n')` to `text.split(/\r?\n/)` to robustly handle different newline characters (`\n` and `\r\n`), resolving an issue where signals were parsed as zero count.
    3.  **Vuex Integration (`frontend/src/store/modules/chart.js`):**
        - Created `addSignalOverlays` action to dispatch signal data to a mutation.
        - Created `ADD_SIGNALS` mutation to update the `chartDataCube` state.
        - **Fix:** Modified the `ADD_SIGNALS` mutation to ensure that when a new `DataCube` instance was created with the new signals, the existing OHLCV data was preserved and passed to the new `DataCube`. This prevented signals from wiping out the main chart data.
    4.  **Signal Display on Chart (Iterative Debugging):**
        - Initial attempts using "SignalMarker" and "Flags" overlay types were unsuccessful (signals processed but not rendered).
        - Switched to using the "Trades" overlay type, which is more suitable for point-in-time events.
        - Ensured the `TradesOverlay` constructor (from `trading-vue-core`) was correctly passed via the `overlays` prop from `Home.vue` to `TradingVue.vue`.
        - **Core Problem:** Identified that `Chart.vue` was receiving the updated `DataCube` (with signals in its internal `data.onchart` array), but the `DataCube`'s own `onchart` getter (accessed via `this.$props.data.onchart`) was returning an empty array.
        - **Solution:** Modified the `onchart` computed property in `frontend/src/trading-vue-core/components/Chart.vue` to directly access the internal raw data array: `this.$props.data.data.onchart`. A similar change was made for `offchart`.
    5.  **Associated UI Bug Fixes:**
        - Corrected arguments to `this.$refs.csvUploader.setUploadStatus()` in `Home.vue` to fix OHLCV uploader status display.
        - Ensured `setUploadStatus` method was available in `SignalUpload.vue`.
- **Result:** Custom signals uploaded via CSV are now correctly parsed, stored in Vuex, and displayed as "Trades" markers on the chart, coexisting with the OHLCV data.
- **Cleanup:** Removed extensive debugging `console.log` statements from `Chart.vue` after the issue was resolved.
- **Next:** Update `TASKS.md`. Review remaining tasks. 

### Action: Refine Signal Uploader and Clean Up Logs
- **Status:** `done`
- **Goal:** Improve the user experience of the signal uploader and remove debugging artifacts.
- **Key Changes:**
    1.  **`frontend/src/components/SignalUpload.vue`:**
        - Removed all verbose `console.log` statements, retaining only a few for critical parsing errors or warnings (e.g., skipping a malformed row).
        - Removed the "Parsed Signals Preview (First 5)" section from the template to avoid displaying raw data.
        - Changed data properties from `uploadStatus`/`isSuccess` to `message`/`messageType` (with states: 'info', 'success', 'error') for clearer status representation and styling flexibility.
        - Updated the `handleUpload` method to set a user-friendly success message (e.g., "Successfully processed X signals from filename.csv") without listing the actual signal data.
        - Ensured the `selectedFile` state and the file input field are reset after a successful upload.
        - Added styling for the `message` display to match `CsvUpload.vue`, providing distinct visual feedback for info, success, and error states.
        - The file input is now disabled when `isLoading` is true to prevent concurrent operations.
        - Added validation in `parseSignalCsv` to ensure critical headers (`timestamp`, `price`, `type`) are present in the CSV, rejecting the file if they are missing.
        - Ensured that the `signalColor` for the parsed signal object correctly defaults based on the signal type (e.g., green for BUY, red for SELL) if not provided in the CSV.
    2.  **`frontend/src/store/modules/chart.js`:**
        - Removed detailed `console.log` blocks from `SET_CHART_DATA` and `ADD_SIGNALS` mutations. Commented-out high-level logs are kept for optional future debugging, but active verbose logging is removed to clean up the console output during normal operation.
- **Result:** The signal uploader now provides clearer, styled feedback to the user, processes all signals from valid CSVs, and the codebase has reduced console noise from previous debugging sessions.
- **Next:** Awaiting next steps from the user. 

### Action: ESLint Fixes & New Mock Data Generation (2019)
- **Status:** `done`
- **Goal:** Resolve Prettier/ESLint formatting errors in `frontend/src/views/Home.vue` and generate new mock OHLCV and signal data for the year 2019.
- **Key Changes:**
    1.  **`frontend/src/views/Home.vue`:**
        - Applied multiple formatting adjustments to the `handleSignalData` method to comply with Prettier rules. This involved changes to line breaks, spacing, and argument formatting for conditions and function calls.
        - The persistent "No Babel config file detected" linter error remains but is considered an environment issue and does not block development.
    2.  **New Mock Data Files Created in `frontend/public/`:**
        - **`mock_ohlcv_2019.csv`:** Created with 20 bars of mock OHLCV data, with timestamps starting from January 1, 2019, and incrementing daily. Includes `timestamp,open,high,low,close,volume`.
        - **`signals_2019.csv`:** Created with 3 mock signals (BUY, SELL, INFO) corresponding to timestamps and prices from `mock_ohlcv_2019.csv`. Includes `timestamp,type,price,label,color,icon`.
- **Note:** The original mock files (`mock_ohlcv_for_signals.csv` and `signals.csv`) were not deleted or overwritten, allowing for their potential continued use or for comparison. The application logic for loading specific default mock data has not been changed as part of this task. 

### Action: Update Default Initial Chart Data to 2019 Mock Data
- **Status:** `done`
- **Goal:** Change the default chart data loaded on application start to use the recently generated `mock_ohlcv_2019.csv` data.
- **Key Changes:**
    1.  **`frontend/src/assets/data.json`:**
        - The `chart.data` array was replaced with the 20 OHLCV data points from `frontend/public/mock_ohlcv_2019.csv`.
        - The `onchart` array was updated to include a new sample EMA overlay (`Sample EMA (2019)`) with 5 data points corresponding to the first few timestamps and approximate price levels of the new 2019 OHLCV data. This ensures the initial chart still demonstrates an onchart overlay relevant to the displayed price data.
- **Result:** The application will now load and display the 2019 mock OHLCV data and a relevant sample EMA by default when the chart view is first initialized. 

### Action: Standardize Uploader Component Styles and Clean Up Logs
- **Status:** `done`
- **Goal:** Refactor `CsvUpload.vue` and `SignalUpload.vue` for consistent layout and message styling. Comment out remaining console logs in core chart components.
- **Key Changes:**
    1.  **`frontend/src/trading-vue-core/components/overlays/Trades.vue`:**
        - Commented out `console.log` and `console.warn` statements within the `draw` method.
    2.  **`frontend/src/trading-vue-core/components/Chart.vue`:**
        - Commented out `console.log` statements within the `overlay_subset` method.
    3.  **`frontend/src/components/CsvUpload.vue`:**
        - **Template:** Restructured to `<h4> (title)` -> `<div> (input + button)` -> `<p> (message)`.
        - **Script:** Updated `data` to use `messageType: 'info' | 'success' | 'error'` (similar to `SignalUpload.vue`). Modified `setUploadStatus` method to accept `messageType` and to reset the file input and `selectedFile` upon successful upload.
        - **Style:** Updated scoped CSS to reflect the new structure. Standardized message styling (`.upload-message`, `.status-success`, `.status-error`, `.status-info`) to be visually consistent with `SignalUpload.vue`, including background colors and left border accents.
    4.  **`frontend/src/components/SignalUpload.vue`:**
        - **Style:** Updated scoped CSS for `.upload-message` and its status modifiers to ensure exact visual consistency with the new styles in `CsvUpload.vue` (backgrounds, borders, text colors, `box-sizing`).
- **Result:** Both uploader components now share a visually consistent structure and feedback mechanism. Core chart components have reduced console output. 

### Action: Final Log Cleanup and Uploader Style Confirmation
- **Status:** `done`
- **Goal:** Comment out any remaining active console logs in core chart components and confirm consistency of uploader message styles.
- **Key Changes/Checks:**
    1.  **`frontend/src/trading-vue-core/components/Chart.vue`:**
        - Commented out a `console.warn` statement in the `get_ohlcv_from_data_cube` method. Other previously addressed logs in this file and `Trades.vue` remain commented out.
    2.  **Uploader Component Styles (`CsvUpload.vue` & `SignalUpload.vue`):**
        - Confirmed that the CSS styles for success and error messages (`.upload-message.status-success`, `.upload-message.status-error`) in `CsvUpload.vue` are identical to those in `SignalUpload.vue`, as per the previous refactoring effort. The visual appearance should be consistent.
- **Result:** Further reduced console output from core chart components. Confirmed that uploader message styling is consistent across both uploader components. 

### Action: Correct Price Uploader Message Logic and Error Handling
- **Status:** `done`
- **Goal:** Ensure `CsvUpload.vue` correctly displays styled success/error messages by aligning its logic with `SignalUpload.vue` and improving how `Home.vue` communicates outcomes.
- **Issue Identified:** User pointed out that `CsvUpload.vue` was not explicitly setting `messageType` for success/error within its own logic (relying on `Home.vue`), and `Home.vue` wasn't consistently passing the correct string (`"success"` or `"error"`) to `CsvUpload.vue`'s `setUploadStatus` method.
- **Key Changes:**
    1.  **`frontend/src/views/Home.vue` (`initiateUpload` method):**
        - Modified the calls to `this.$refs.csvUploader.setUploadStatus(isLoading, message, messageType)`.
        - For successful uploads, the `messageType` argument is now explicitly passed as the string `"success"`.
        - For errors (both from backend response and general catch block), the `messageType` argument is now explicitly passed as the string `"error"`.
        - Retained `console.error` for network/backend issues to aid developer debugging, but the user-facing message is now correctly styled.
- **Result:** The `CsvUpload.vue` component now receives the correct `messageType` string from `Home.vue` upon completion (or failure) of an OHLCV file upload. This allows its scoped CSS rules for `.upload-message.status-success` and `.upload-message.status-error` to be applied correctly, leading to visually consistent feedback messages that match `SignalUpload.vue`.
- **Next:** Update `TASKS.md`. Proceed with Task 4.0. 

### Action: Refine Price Uploader Error Console Logging
- **Status:** `done`
- **Goal:** Prevent `Home.vue` from logging handled backend validation errors (HTTP 400, 422) to the browser console when uploading OHLCV CSV files, while still displaying user-friendly styled error messages.
- **Issue Identified:** While styled error messages were shown, `Home.vue` also logged the full `AxiosError` to the console for backend-rejected CSVs (e.g., missing columns), creating unnecessary console noise for handled errors.
- **Key Changes:**
    1.  **`frontend/src/views/Home.vue` (`initiateUpload` method's `catch` block):**
        - The `console.error("Error uploading CSV:", error);` line was modified.
        - It now conditionally logs only if the error response status is *not* 400 (Bad Request) and *not* 422 (Unprocessable Entity). 
        - User-facing error messages via `this.$refs.csvUploader.setUploadStatus(...)` remain unchanged and will always be shown.
- **Result:** For typical CSV validation errors returned by the backend (400/422), the user will see the styled error message in the UI, but the browser console will remain clean of the `AxiosError` log from `Home.vue`. Unexpected errors (e.g., network issues, 500 server errors) will still be logged to the console for developer debugging.
- **Next:** Awaiting user confirmation and next steps. 

### Action: Implement Client-Side CSV Header Validation for Price Uploader
- **Status:** `done`
- **Goal:** Add client-side validation to `CsvUpload.vue` to check for required OHLCV headers before attempting to upload the file, reducing unnecessary backend calls and console network errors for basic format issues.
- **Key Changes:**
    1.  **`frontend/src/components/CsvUpload.vue`:**
        - Added a new data property `isValidFile: false` to track client-side validation state.
        - The `handleFileSelect` method was made `async`.
        - Implemented a new helper method `readFileContent(file)` using `FileReader` to get the file's text content.
        - In `handleFileSelect`:
            - After a file is selected, its content is read.
            - The first line (header) is extracted and converted to lowercase.
            - Required OHLCV columns (`timestamp`, `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, `volume`) are checked against the parsed header.
            - If any required columns are missing: 
                - An error message detailing missing and expected columns is set.
                - `messageType` is set to `"error"`.
                - `isValidFile` is set to `false`.
                - The file input field (`this.$refs.csvFile.value`) is cleared to allow re-selection of the same (potentially corrected) file.
                - `this.selectedFile` is also cleared.
            - If all headers are present:
                - An informational message is set (e.g., "File is valid. Ready to upload.").
                - `isValidFile` is set to `true`.
            - Basic `try...catch` was added around file reading/parsing to handle potential `FileReader` errors.
        - The "Upload OHLCV" button's `:disabled` binding was updated to include `!isValidFile`.
        - The `triggerFileUpload` method now also checks `this.isValidFile` and returns early with an error message if the file is not client-side validated.
        - In `setUploadStatus`, when an upload is successful, `isValidFile` is reset to `false`.
- **Result:** The OHLCV price uploader now performs an initial check for required CSV headers in the browser. If headers are missing, it displays an error locally and prevents the file from being sent to the backend, thus avoiding the "400 Bad Request" network log in the console for this specific type of error. The behavior is now more aligned with `SignalUpload.vue` for initial format validation.
- **Next:** Awaiting user confirmation and next steps. 

### Action: Standardize Client-Side Validation UX for Both Uploaders
- **Status:** `done`
- **Goal:** Ensure both `CsvUpload.vue` and `SignalUpload.vue` provide a consistent user experience for client-side CSV header validation, particularly regarding button state and file re-selection.
- **Key Changes:**
    1.  **`frontend/src/components/CsvUpload.vue`:**
        - Removed `!isValidFile` from the upload button's `:disabled` binding. The button's enabled state now primarily depends on `!selectedFile || isLoading`. This allows the user to select a new file immediately after a client-side validation error without the button being stuck in a disabled state due to the previous invalid file.
        - The `triggerFileUpload` method still correctly checks `this.isValidFile` before proceeding with an upload attempt.
    2.  **`frontend/src/components/SignalUpload.vue`:**
        - Added `isValidFile: false` to the component's `data`.
        - Implemented `readFileContent(file)` helper method (same as in `CsvUpload.vue`).
        - Created a new `async` method `validateSignalCsvHeaders(file)`:
            - Reads the file content and extracts the header.
            - Checks for critical headers: `timestamp`, `type`, `price`.
            - Sets `this.message`, `this.messageType`, and `this.isValidFile` based on validation results.
        - Modified `handleFileChange` to be `async`:
            - Calls `validateSignalCsvHeaders` upon file selection.
            - Updates component messages based on the validation outcome.
            - If `validateSignalCsvHeaders` indicates failure (by not setting `isValidFile` to true or by `this.messageType` being `'error'`), it ensures the file input is cleared and `this.selectedFile` is reset to allow re-selection.
        - Changed the "Upload Signals" button's `:disabled` binding to `!selectedFile || isLoading`.
        - Updated `handleUpload`:
            - Now checks `this.isValidFile` at the beginning. If `false`, it displays an error, clears the input/selected file, and returns.
            - Resets `isValidFile` to `false` after a successful upload.
        - Refined `parseSignalCsv`:
            - Made it `async` to use `await this.readFileContent(file)` for consistency.
            - Added more robust checks for empty or header-only files, rejecting the promise with specific user-friendly messages.
            - Retained its internal header validation as a safeguard, providing specific error messages if critical headers are missing during the full parse.
            - Added a check for rows with insufficient columns to prevent runtime errors.
- **Result:** Both uploader components now have a harmonized client-side validation flow. When a file is selected, basic header validation occurs. If it fails, an error message is shown, the input is cleared, and the user can immediately attempt to select a different file. The upload button is re-enabled upon new file selection. This prevents unnecessary backend calls for basic format errors and keeps the console cleaner, while providing immediate feedback to the user.
- **Next:** Awaiting user testing and confirmation of the new behavior for both uploaders. 

### Action: Resolve ESLint Errors and Debug Signal CSV Parsing
- **Status:** `done`
- **Goal:** Fix ESLint errors in `frontend/src/components/SignalUpload.vue` and resolve an issue where valid signal CSV files were incorrectly reported as empty or header-only.
- **Key Changes & Fixes:**
    1.  **ESLint (`frontend/src/components/SignalUpload.vue`):**
        - Ran `npm run lint -- --fix` to correct Prettier formatting issues.
        - Refactored the `parseSignalCsv` method to remove the `no-async-promise-executor` ESLint error. The method now directly awaits `this.readFileContent(file)` and uses `try/catch` for error handling, throwing errors to be caught by the caller (`handleUpload`).
    2.  **Signal CSV Parsing Logic (`frontend/src/components/SignalUpload.vue` - `parseSignalCsv` method):**
        - **Issue:** Valid CSV files (e.g., `signals_2019.csv` with a header and 3 data rows) were being misidentified as having only 1 line, triggering the "Signal CSV file only contains a header row or is empty" error.
        - **Root Cause Analysis (via added `console.log`s):** The `fileText.split(/\r?\n/)` was not correctly splitting the file content into an array of lines; it was producing an array with a single element containing the entire file content (with `\n` characters still embedded).
        - **Fix:** Changed the line splitting method from `fileText.split(/\r?\n/)` to `fileText.split('\n')`. This correctly breaks the file content (as read by `FileReader.readAsText`) into an array of individual lines.
        - **Cleanup:** Removed the temporary diagnostic `console.log` statements after confirming the fix.
- **Result:** All ESLint errors in `SignalUpload.vue` (excluding the persistent Babel config warning) are resolved. The signal CSV uploader now correctly parses valid CSV files with multiple lines, and the "header row or is empty" error no longer occurs for such files.
- **Next:** Update project documentation (`DIARY.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `TASKS.md`).

### Action: Task 6.1.0, 6.1.1, 6.1.2 - Docker, Redis & TimescaleDB Setup
- **Status:** `done`
- **Date:** 2025-05-19
- **Result:**
    - User confirmed Docker Desktop (macOS) was installed and running (Task 6.1.0).
    - Created `docker-compose.yml` in the project root.
    - Defined and successfully started a Redis service (`inchart_redis`) using the `redis:alpine` image, running in a Docker container. Data persistence is configured with a named volume `redis_data`. Port 6379 is mapped to the host (Task 6.1.1).
    - Updated `docker-compose.yml` to include a TimescaleDB service (`inchart_postgres_timescaledb`) using the `timescale/timescaledb:latest-pg16` image, running in a Docker container. Credentials (`inchart_admin`, `p3ace-0f-ouR-t!me`, `inchart_db`) are configured. Data persistence is configured with a named volume `postgres_timescaledb_data`. Container port 5432 is mapped to host port 5433 to avoid conflicts (Task 6.1.2).
    - Both Redis and TimescaleDB containers are confirmed to be running successfully via `docker ps`.
- **Next:** Proceed with Task 6.1.3: Backend Project Configuration to connect to these Dockerized services.

### Action: Review .env Configuration and Critical Rules
- **Status:** `done`
- **Date:** 2025-05-19
- **Result:**
    - User clarified the actual environment variables present in their root `.env` file.
    - Confirmed that `project_guidelines/CRITICAL_RULES.md` already contains a comprehensive rule regarding the storage and use of credentials and configurations in a root `.env` file.
    - Noted the need to address Binance API rate limits and the use of read-only keys in relevant future tasks.
- **Next:** Proceed with Task 6.1.3: Backend Project Configuration, ensuring it aligns with the user's actual `.env` variables and the established critical rules.

### Action: Task 6.1.4 - Define Kline Data Model & Migration (TimescaleDB)
- **Status:** `done`
- **Date:** 2025-05-20
- **Result:**
    - Successfully defined the `Kline` SQLAlchemy model in `backend/app/models.py` with a composite primary key `(symbol, timeframe, open_time)` to be compatible with TimescaleDB hypertable partitioning.
    - Manually populated and refined the Alembic migration script `backend/alembic/versions/670a0da83f87_add_klines_table_for_timescaledb.py` to correctly create the `klines` table with the composite PK and then convert it to a hypertable using `SELECT create_hypertable(\'klines\'::regclass, \'open_time\'::name);`
    - After extensive troubleshooting, applied the migration successfully against the Dockerized TimescaleDB instance.
- **Key Learnings & Troubleshooting Summary (TimescaleDB Hypertable Migration Journey):**
    1.  **`DATABASE_URL` is Paramount:** Initial Alembic issues stemmed from `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` pointing to a local PostgreSQL (port 5432) instead of the Dockerized TimescaleDB (port 5433). Correcting this was the first major breakthrough.
    2.  **User Roles in Dockerized PostgreSQL:** For the `postgres` Docker image (which `timescale/timescaledb` is based on), if `POSTGRES_USER` is set in `docker-compose.yml` (e.g., to `inchart_admin`), that user becomes the superuser, and the default `postgres` user may not exist or have the expected role. In our case, `inchart_admin` is the superuser.
    3.  **`create_hypertable` Argument Type Inference:** The persistent `function ... does not exist` error for `create_hypertable` (even when `\df` showed it in `public` schema and `public` was in `search_path`) was due to PostgreSQL's inability to infer argument types from string literals within Alembic\'s `op.execute()` context. Explicitly casting arguments (e.g., `\'klines\'::regclass`, `\'open_time\'::name`) in the SQL call resolved this critical function signature mismatch.
    4.  **TimescaleDB Hypertable Primary Key Constraint:** A `PRIMARY KEY` or `UNIQUE` constraint on a hypertable *must* include the time partitioning column. The initial single `id` primary key on `klines` caused the `cannot create a unique index without the column ... (used in partitioning)` error. Changing the PK to the composite `(symbol, timeframe, open_time)` fixed this.
    5.  **Alembic & Transactional DDL:** The `op.create_table()` and subsequent `op.execute(SELECT create_hypertable(...))` occur in the same transaction. The error `relation \"klines\" does not exist` (seen in manual `psql` tests if table wasn\'t pre-created) was a distractor from the Alembic context where the table *was* created but the function call failed due to type inference.
    6.  **Interactive `psql` Diagnostics:** Connecting directly to the target database inside the Docker container (`docker exec -it inchart_postgres_timescaledb psql -U inchart_admin -d inchart_db`) and using `SHOW search_path;`, `\df *function_name*`, `\dx extension_name` was essential for accurate diagnosis of the database state, function visibility, and extension status.
    7.  **Migration File Management:** When Alembic auto-generation is problematic, ensure `down_revision` pointers in manually adjusted/created migration scripts are correct to maintain history integrity.
- **Next:** Proceed with Task 6.1.5: Implement Redis Connection Utility.

### Action: Task 6.1.5 - Implement Redis Connection Utility
- **Status:** `done`
- **Date:** 2025-05-20
- **Result:**
    - Added `redis` package (v6.1.0) to `requirements.txt`.
    - Installed `redis` into the backend virtual environment (`./.venv/bin/pip install -r ../requirements.txt`).
    - Created `backend/app/redis_utils.py` with:
        - `get_redis_connection()`: Connects to Redis using `REDIS_HOST` and `REDIS_PORT` from `config.settings`, performs a ping to verify, and returns a Redis client instance (or `None` on error).
        - `ping_redis(redis_client)`: Pings the Redis server using a provided client.
    - Updated `backend/app/__init__.py` to export `get_redis_connection` for easier access.
- **Next:** Proceed with Task 6.2.1: Ingestion Service Structure.

### Action: Task 6.2.1 - Ingestion Service Structure
- **Status:** `done`
- **Date:** 2025-05-20
- **Result:**
    - Created directory `backend/data_ingestion_service/`.
    - Created `backend/data_ingestion_service/__init__.py`.
    - Created `backend/data_ingestion_service/service_utils.py` with a `setup_logging` function for basic console logging.
    - Created `backend/data_ingestion_service/main.py` as the entry point for the standalone ingestion service. This script includes:
        - Setup for asyncio and logging.
        - Import of shared application settings, DB utilities, and Redis utilities from `backend.app`.
        - Parsing of `PROACTIVE_SYMBOLS` and `PROACTIVE_TIMEFRAMES` from settings.
        - Initial connection checks for TimescaleDB and Redis.
        - Graceful shutdown handling for `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` signals.
        - A main asynchronous loop (`run_service`) that currently idles while waiting for a shutdown signal, with placeholders for future WebSocket management and data processing tasks.
- **Next:** Proceed with Task 6.2.2: Binance WebSocket Connector Module.

### Action: Task 6.2.2 - Binance WebSocket Connector Module
- **Status:** `done`
- **Date:** 2025-05-20
- **Result:**
    - Created `backend/data_ingestion_service/binance_connector.py` containing the `BinanceWebSocketManager` class.
        - This class is responsible for managing a single WebSocket connection for a specific symbol/timeframe.
        - It constructs the Binance kline stream URL (e.g., `wss://stream.binance.com:9443/ws/btcusdt@kline_1m`).
        - It parses incoming JSON messages, validates them as closed klines, extracts relevant fields (`symbol`, `timeframe`, `open_time`, `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, `volume`, `is_closed`, etc.), and passes them to the `data_handler_callback`.
        - Implements robust reconnection logic using exponential backoff (with configurable parameters) if the connection drops or fails to establish.
        - Handles graceful shutdown via the global `shutdown_event`.
    - Updated `backend/data_ingestion_service/main.py` to:
        - Import `BinanceWebSocketManager`.
        - In `run_service()`, iterate through `PROACTIVE_SYMBOLS` and `PROACTIVE_TIMEFRAMES`.
        - For each pair, create an instance of `BinanceWebSocketManager`.
        - Pass a placeholder `kline_data_processor` callback to the manager (to be implemented in Task 6.2.3).
        - Create an `asyncio.task` for each manager's `run()` method and store it in `active_tasks`.
        - The main loop now waits for these tasks or the shutdown signal.
        - Graceful shutdown logic now cancels these tasks.
- **Next:** Proceed with Task 6.2.3: Live Data Processing & Persistence Pipeline.

### Action: Task 6.2.3 - Live Data Processing & Persistence Pipeline
- **Status:** `done`
- **Date:** 2025-05-20
- **Result:**
    - Added `MAX_KLINES_IN_REDIS: int = 2000` to `backend/app/config.py`.
    - Heavily modified `backend/data_ingestion_service/main.py`:
        - Imported `Kline` model, `Decimal`, `pg_insert` from `sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql`, `SQLAlchemyError`, `json`, and `functools.partial`.
        - Implemented the `async def kline_data_processor(kline_data: dict, redis_client, db_session_factory)` function:
            - **Mapping:** Converts incoming `kline_data` (from Binance WS) to a `Kline` SQLAlchemy model instance. Ensures `Decimal` for prices/volumes and `int` for timestamps.
            - **TimescaleDB:** 
                - Obtains a new DB session using `db_session_factory` (which is `SessionLocal`).
                - Constructs a PostgreSQL `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` statement using `pg_insert`, targeting the composite PK `(symbol, timeframe, open_time)`.
                - Executes the statement and commits the session using `asyncio.to_thread` for non-blocking synchronous DB calls.
                - Logs success or conflict, handles `SQLAlchemyError` with rollback and session closure.
            - **Redis Cache (if DB op successful/conflict):**
                - Constructs Redis key: `klines:<symbol>:<timeframe>`.
                - Prepares kline data as JSON (converting `Decimal` to string).
                - Uses `redis_client.zadd` (via `asyncio.to_thread`) to add kline to a sorted set (score: `open_time`).
                - Trims sorted set using `redis_client.zremrangebyrank` (via `asyncio.to_thread`) to `settings.MAX_KLINES_IN_REDIS`.
                - Logs operations and handles Redis exceptions.
            - **Redis Pub/Sub (if DB op successful/conflict):**
                - Constructs channel name: `kline_updates:<symbol>:<timeframe>`.
                - Publishes kline JSON to channel using `redis_client.publish` (via `asyncio.to_thread`).
                - Logs operations and handles Redis exceptions.
        - Updated `run_service()`:
            - Imports `SessionLocal` directly for the `db_session_factory`.
            - Uses `functools.partial` to create `bound_kline_processor`, passing `redis_client` and `SessionLocal` to `kline_data_processor` when creating `BinanceWebSocketManager` instances.
            - Improved Redis client shutdown logic.
- **Next:** Proceed with Task 6.2.4: Proactive Tracking Orchestration.

### Action: Task 6.2.4 - Proactive Tracking Orchestration
- **Status:** `done`
- **Date:** 2025-05-20
- **Result:**
    - The existing implementation in `backend/data_ingestion_service/main.py` already fulfills this task.
    - The `run_service` function reads `PROACTIVE_SYMBOLS` and `PROACTIVE_TIMEFRAMES` from `settings` (loaded from `.env`).
    - It then iterates through these configurations, creating and launching a `BinanceWebSocketManager` instance for each symbol/timeframe pair to maintain active WebSocket subscriptions.
- **Next:** Proceed with Task 6.2.5: Historical Data Backfill Module (Binance REST API).

### Action: Task 6.2.5 - Historical Data Backfill Module (Binance REST API)
- **Status:** `done`
- **Date:** 2025-05-20
- **Result:**
    - Created `backend/data_ingestion_service/historical_data_fetcher.py`.
    - Implemented `async def fetch_historical_klines(...)`:
        - Uses `httpx.AsyncClient` to fetch from Binance SPOT API (`/api/v3/klines`).
        - Maps internal timeframes (e.g., "1m") to Binance API interval strings.
        - Handles pagination by iteratively calling the API with adjusted `startTime`.
        - Implements retry logic with exponential backoff for HTTP errors `429` (Too Many Requests) and `418` (IP Banned), as well as general `httpx.RequestError`.
        - Uses `settings.BINANCE_API_KEY` in request headers if available.
        - Converts raw kline data from API into `Kline` model instances.
        - Respects `end_time_ms` to limit fetching range.
        - Stops when no more data is returned or the limit per call is not met.
    - Implemented `async def save_historical_klines_to_db(...)`:
        - Accepts a list of `Kline` model instances and a `db_session_factory`.
        - Converts `Kline` objects to a list of dictionaries for bulk insertion.
        - Uses `sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql.insert` with `on_conflict_do_nothing` on the composite primary key `(symbol, timeframe, open_time)`.
        - Executes database operations (insert, commit, rollback, close) in `asyncio.to_thread`.
        - Returns a tuple of `(inserted_count, conflicted_count)`.
    - Added an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block with a `main_test()` async function for direct module testing (commented out by default).
- **Next:** Proceed with Task 6.2.6: Gap Detection & Filling Logic.

### Action: Task 6.2.6 - Gap Detection & Filling Logic
- **Status:** `done`
- **Date:** 2025-05-20
- **Result:**
    - Added `INITIAL_BACKFILL_DAYS` and `HISTORICAL_FETCH_BUFFER_KLINES` to `backend/app/config.py`.
    - Modified `backend/data_ingestion_service/main.py`:
        - Added helper function `_timeframe_to_ms(timeframe_str)` and `TIMEFRAME_MS_EQUIVALENTS` mapping.
        - Added async helper function `_get_latest_kline_open_time_from_db(symbol, timeframe, db_session_factory)` to query TimescaleDB for the most recent kline open_time.
        - Integrated gap detection logic into `run_service()` before starting `BinanceWebSocketManager` instances:
            - For each proactive symbol/timeframe pair, it checks the latest kline in the DB.
            - If no data exists, it calculates a `backfill_start_time_ms` based on `INITIAL_BACKFILL_DAYS`.
            - If data exists, it calculates `backfill_start_time_ms` from the last kline plus one interval.
            - It defines a `current_target_ms` (current time, aligned to interval start, minus `HISTORICAL_FETCH_BUFFER_KLINES`).
            - If `backfill_start_time_ms` is earlier than `current_target_ms`, it calls `fetch_historical_klines` and `save_historical_klines_to_db` to fill the detected gap.
        - The `kline_data_processor` was updated to correctly use `symbol` and `timeframe` arguments passed via `functools.partial` and to parse kline data according to Binance WebSocket message structure (e.g., using `kline_data['t']` for open time, `kline_data['x']` for `is_closed`).
        - Added slight staggering for initial WebSocket connection attempts.
- **Next:** Proceed with Task 6.3.1: Kline Data API Endpoint (Historical).

### Action: Task 6.2 - Backend: Data Ingestion Service (Background Worker/Process) - COMPLETION
- **Status:** `done`
- **Date:** 2025-05-20
- **Result:**
    - All sub-tasks (6.2.1 to 6.2.6) for the Data Ingestion Service are complete.
    - The service now has a defined structure, connects to Binance WebSockets, processes live kline data, persists it to TimescaleDB, caches it in Redis, publishes updates via Redis Pub/Sub, fetches historical data via Binance REST API, and implements gap detection and filling logic on startup.
    - The service is designed to run as a separate, resilient background process.
- **Next:** Create comprehensive project documentation in `DOCUMENTATION.md` and then proceed with Task 6.3.1: Kline Data API Endpoint (Historical).

### Action: Task 6.3.1 - Kline Data API Endpoint (Historical)
- **Status:** `done`
- **Date:** 2025-05-20
- **Result:**
    - Added `KlineBase` and `KlineRead` Pydantic schemas to `backend/app/schemas.py` for API responses (converting Decimals to floats).
    - Implemented a GET endpoint `/data/klines/{symbol}/{timeframe}` in `backend/app/routers/data.py`.
        - Takes `symbol` and `timeframe` as path parameters.
        - Accepts optional query parameters: `start_ms` (Unix ms), `end_ms` (Unix ms), `limit` (default 1000, max 5000).
        - Fetches kline data from TimescaleDB (`klines` table) using SQLAlchemy, filtering by symbol, timeframe, and time range.
        - Orders data by `open_time` (ascending, or descending if only `end_ms` is provided, then reverses for client).
        - Returns a list of `KlineRead` objects.
    - Updated the tag for the `data.router` in `backend/app/main.py` to "Data Services".
- **Next:** Proceed with Task 6.3.2: API Data Retrieval Logic (Refinements/Redis check - if needed immediately, or move to Backend WebSocket).

### Action: Task 6.3.2 - API Data Retrieval Logic (Historical Klines with Redis Cache & Backfill Status)
- **Status:** `done`
- **Result:**
    - Incremented `VERSION_COUNTER.txt` to `12`.
    - Modified `backend/app/schemas.py` to define `KlineHistoricalResponse` which includes `klines: List[KlineRead]`, `backfill_status: Optional[str]`, and `backfill_last_updated_ts: Optional[int]`.
    - Significantly updated the `/data/klines/{symbol}/{timeframe}` endpoint in `backend/app/routers/data.py`:
        - It now accepts `start_ms`, `end_ms`, and `limit` query parameters.
        - **Backfill Status Check:** Before fetching kline data, it checks Redis for a `backfill_status:<symbol>:<timeframe>` key (set by the ingestion service). If found and recent, it populates `backfill_status` and `backfill_last_updated_ts` in the response. Handles stale "in_progress" statuses.
        - **Redis Cache Check:** If the request's time range is recent (within `settings.API_REDIS_LOOKBACK_MS` from current time, or `end_ms` is recent/None), it queries the `klines:<symbol>:<timeframe>` sorted set in Redis.
            - The query range for Redis is adjusted to be slightly wider (using `MAX_KLINES_IN_REDIS` and `API_REDIS_LOOKBACK_MS` as heuristics) to ensure relevant recent data is captured.
            - Fetched klines from Redis are parsed from JSON and filtered by the original `start_ms` if provided.
        - **TimescaleDB Query:**
            - If Redis data is insufficient or not applicable, it queries TimescaleDB.
            - The `end_ms` for the DB query is adjusted to be just before the oldest kline found in Redis to prevent overlap, if applicable and logical within the requested range.
            - The `limit` for the DB query is adjusted based on the number of klines already retrieved from Redis.
            - The query order (ASC/DESC `open_time`) is determined based on whether `end_ms` is specified (favoring latest) or not (favoring oldest from `start_ms`).
        - **Data Combination & Response:**
            - Klines from Redis and DB are combined.
            - Deduplication is performed using a dictionary with `(symbol, timeframe, open_time)` as the key.
            - The combined list is sorted by `open_time`.
            - A final `limit` is applied. Special handling ensures that if only `end_ms` and `limit` are provided, the *latest* `limit` klines up to `end_ms` are returned.
        - Logging was added for Redis and DB operations.
        - The helper function `_timeframe_to_ms` was added to `data.py` (similar to the one in the ingestion service).
    - Updated the `@router.get` decorator in `data.py` to use `response_model=KlineHistoricalResponse` and tag "Kline Data".
    - The tag for the data router in `backend/app/main.py` was updated to "Data Services".
- **Next:** Update `TASKS.md`. Then proceed to Task 6.3.3: Backend WebSocket for Live Kline Updates.

### Action: Task 6.3.3 - Backend WebSocket for Live Kline Updates
- **Status:** `done`
- **Result:**
    - Incremented `VERSION_COUNTER.txt` to `13`.
    - Added a new WebSocket endpoint `@router.websocket("/ws/klines/{symbol}/{timeframe}")` to `backend/app/routers/data.py`.
    - Necessary imports like `WebSocket`, `WebSocketDisconnect` from `fastapi`, `redis` (for exceptions), and `WebSocketState` from `starlette.websockets` were added/ensured.
    - **Connection Handling:** The endpoint accepts WebSocket connections, logs acceptance.
    - **Redis Pub/Sub:**
        - Retrieves a Redis connection using `get_redis_connection()`.
        - Creates a Pub/Sub object and subscribes to the channel `kline_updates:{SYMBOL}:{TIMEFRAME}` using `asyncio.to_thread` for the synchronous Redis client library calls.
        - Sends a subscription confirmation message to the client.
    - **Message Relaying Loop:**
        - Enters a `while True` loop to listen for messages.
        - Uses `pubsub.get_message(ignore_subscribe_messages=True, timeout=1.0)` (via `asyncio.to_thread`) to check for new klines from Redis.
        - If a kline message is received, it's decoded and sent to the WebSocket client as text (JSON string).
        - Includes a non-blocking check for client-sent messages (e.g., `ping`) using `asyncio.wait_for(websocket.receive_text(), timeout=0.01)` and responds with `pong` if a ping is received.
    - **Error & Disconnection Handling:**
        - Catches `WebSocketDisconnect` to handle client-initiated disconnections gracefully.
        - Catches `redis.exceptions.ConnectionError` and other general exceptions, logs them, and attempts to send an error message to the client.
        - The `finally` block ensures cleanup:
            - Unsubscribes from the Redis Pub/Sub channel.
            - Closes the Pub/Sub connection.
            - Closes the main Redis client connection.
            - Explicitly closes the WebSocket connection if it's not already in a disconnected state (using `WebSocketState.DISCONNECTED` check).
- **Next:** Update `TASKS.md`. All backend API tasks (6.3.x) are now complete. Proceed to Task 6.4: Frontend Chart Data Integration & Mode Switching.

### Action: Task 6.4.1, 6.4.2, 6.4.3 - Frontend Mode Switching Foundation
- **Status:** `done`
- **Date:** 2025-05-20
- **Result:**
    - **Vuex (chart.js):**
        - State for `chartMode`, `lastLiveAsset`, `lastLiveTimeframe` confirmed/added.
        - Default `chartMode` set to "custom", loading `SampleData` initially.
        - Mutations `RESET_CHART_TO_DEFAULT` (for custom mode) and `CLEAR_CHART_DATA` (for live mode) implemented.
        - `setChartMode` action now dispatches specific actions (`switchToCustomModeAction`, `switchToLiveModeAction`) to commit these mutations.
    - **Home.vue:**
        - Added "Live Chart" / "Custom Chart" mode switcher buttons.
        - Implemented conditional rendering for `CsvUpload` (custom mode) and `SignalUpload` (live mode) components.
        - Added a watcher for `chartMode`:
            - Increments `chartResetKey` to ensure chart re-renders on mode switch.
            - Vuex actions handle resetting/clearing data automatically.
- **Next:** Task 6.4.4: Paginated History Loading (Live Mode) - Initial Load.

### Action: Task 6.4.4 (Part 1) - Initial Historical Data Load for Live Mode
- **Status:** `done`
- **Date:** 2025-05-20
- **Result:**
    - **Vuex (chart.js):**
        - Added `SET_LIVE_CHART_DATA` mutation and `setLiveChartData` action to load klines into `DataCube` for live mode.
    - **Home.vue:**
        - Mapped `lastLiveAsset`, `lastLiveTimeframe` getters and `setLiveChartData` action.
        - Implemented `fetchInitialHistoricalKlines()` method:
            - Called when `chartMode` switches to 'live'.
            - Fetches an initial chunk of ~300 klines from `/data/klines/{symbol}/{timeframe}` for the default live asset/timeframe.
            - Dispatches `setLiveChartData` to update the chart.
            - Logs API backfill status.
            - Attempts to `setRange()` on the chart to the loaded data and increments `chartResetKey`.
- **Next:** Task 6.4.4: Paginated History Loading (Live Mode) - Panning Left for More Data.

### Action: Task 6.4.4 (Part 2) - Paginated History Loading (Panning Left)
- **Status:** `done`
- **Date:** 2025-05-20
- **Result:**
    - **Vuex (chart.js):**
        - Added `PREPEND_HISTORICAL_KLINES` mutation to combine older klines with existing ones, sort, deduplicate, and update `DataCube`.
        - Added `prependHistoricalKlines` action to commit the mutation and return the new oldest kline's timestamp.
    - **Home.vue:**
        - Added `isLoadingMoreHistory` and `oldestKlineTimestampLoaded` data properties.
        - `fetchInitialHistoricalKlines` now sets `oldestKlineTimestampLoaded`.
        - Implemented `handleRangeChange` method, connected to `TradingVue`'s `@range-changed` event.
            - This method detects if the user pans near the oldest loaded kline (within a `loadMoreThresholdFactor` of intervals).
        - Implemented `fetchOlderHistoricalKlines` method:
            - Called by `handleRangeChange`.
            - Fetches klines from the API with `end_ms` set to before `oldestKlineTimestampLoaded`.
            - Dispatches `prependHistoricalKlines` Vuex action.
            - Updates `oldestKlineTimestampLoaded` with the new oldest timestamp.
            - Increments `chartResetKey`.
        - Asset/Timeframe display in UI now dynamically shows `lastLiveAsset` and `lastLiveTimeframe` in live mode.
- **Next:** Task 6.4.5: Live Price Updates on Chart (Live Mode via Frontend WebSocket).

### Action: Task 6.4.6 - Signal Handling Across Modes
- **Status:** `done`
- **Date:** 2025-05-20
- **Result:**
    - Reviewed signal handling logic in Vuex (`chart.js`).
    - The `ADD_SIGNALS` mutation correctly preserves OHLCV data when adding signals.
    - Mode switching logic (`RESET_CHART_TO_DEFAULT` for custom, `CLEAR_CHART_DATA` for live initial) correctly resets chart states.
    - Identified that `SET_LIVE_CHART_DATA` (used for loading initial historical live data) was clearing `onchart` overlays.
    - **Fix:** Modified the `SET_LIVE_CHART_DATA` mutation in `chart.js` to preserve existing `onchart` and `offchart` overlays. This ensures signals added in live mode persist when historical data loads.
    - Signals now correctly persist with live data (initial load, prepended history, WS updates) and are cleared when switching to 'custom' mode (which loads mock data).
- **Next:** Task 6.4.7: UI for Data Gaps/Loading States (Live Mode).

### Action: Task 6.4.7 - UI for Data Gaps/Loading States (Live Mode)
- **Status:** `done`
- **Date:** 2025-05-20
- **Result:**
    - **Home.vue:**
        - Added data properties: `currentBackfillStatus`, `currentBackfillTimestamp`, `isInitialLiveLoading`.
        - Implemented a new `.chart-status-indicators` section in the template to display messages.
        - Shows "Loading initial live chart data..." when `isInitialLiveLoading` is true.
        - Shows "Loading more historical data..." when `isLoadingMoreHistory` is true (for paged loads).
        - Shows a persistent message if API response indicates `backfill_status` is "in_progress" or "stale_in_progress", including the last update timestamp.
        - Logic in `fetchInitialHistoricalKlines` and `fetchOlderHistoricalKlines` updated to set these status properties from API responses.
        - `chartMode` watcher resets these statuses on mode change.
- **Next:** All sub-tasks for 6.4 are complete. Proceed to Task 6.5: Testing, Refinement & Documentation.

## [Session 22] - 2025-05-21 (Continued)

**Development:**
- **Task 6.5.1 (Backend Unit & Integration Tests):**
    - Successfully ran `test_get_klines_with_data_from_db` after resolving several issues related to Pydantic schema validation (`KlineRead`), timezone handling between SQLite (naive UTC) and Python (aware UTC), and ensuring correct timestamp calculations in test assertions. The API endpoint `/data/klines/{symbol:path}/{timeframe}` was modified to use `{symbol:path}` to handle symbols containing slashes.
- Addressed user queries regarding Docker's role, initial data population strategy for TimescaleDB, and planned a new frontend UX task for data preload/initial loading states.

**Next Steps:**
- Continue with backend testing (Task 6.5.1), focusing on Redis interactions and WebSocket endpoint tests.
- Implement the new frontend UX task (6.4.8).


## [Session 21] - 2025-05-21

**Development:**
- **Task 6.5.1 (Backend Unit & Integration Tests):**
    - Began setting up backend tests.
    - Added `pytest-asyncio` and `redis` to `backend/requirements.txt` and installed them.
    - Created `backend/tests/` directory and `backend/tests/conftest.py` with `test_client`, `db_session`, and `override_get_db` fixtures. Using in-memory SQLite for test DB.
    - Created `backend/tests/api/test_data_api.py`.
    - Troubleshooting initial test setup: `PYTHONPATH` for `pytest`, `ModuleNotFoundError` (fixed with `backend/__init__.py`), `ImportError` for `Base` (uncommented in `database.py`), `TypeError` for `AsyncClient` (switched to `ASGITransport`).
    - Removed custom `event_loop` fixture in favor of `pytest-asyncio`'s default.
    - Created `pytest.ini` in project root with `asyncio_mode = auto`.
    - Started implementing `test_get_klines_with_data_from_db`.
    - **Encountered and resolved `TypeError: 'is_closed' is an invalid keyword argument for Kline`**: Corrected test data creation for `Kline` model which was missing some fields and had `is_closed` (which is in `KlineRead` schema, not ORM model directly).
    - **Encountered and resolved `TypeError: SQLite DateTime type only accepts Python datetime and date objects as input`**: Converted integer timestamps to `datetime` objects in test data before `Kline` instantiation.
    - **Encountered and resolved `AssertionError: assert 404 == 200` for API call**: The test symbol `TESTCOIN/USD` path parameter was being incorrectly split. Changed API route in `backend/app/routers/data.py` from `/klines/{symbol}/{timeframe}` to `/klines/{symbol:path}/{timeframe}` to correctly handle symbols with slashes.
    - **Debugging `AssertionError` in `test_get_klines_with_data_from_db` related to incorrect number of klines returned by API / timestamp mismatches.** This led to a deep dive into `KlineRead` Pydantic schema, ORM model `datetime` fields, and their conversion to integer timestamps for JSON.
        - **Identified Pydantic validation error:** `Input should be a valid integer [type=int_type, input_value=datetime.datetime(...)]` because `KlineRead` was expecting `int` for `open_time`/`close_time` but ORM was providing `datetime`. Changed `KlineBase.open_time` and `KlineBase.close_time` to `datetime` in `schemas.py` and added `json_encoders` in `KlineRead.Config` to output integer timestamps in the final JSON.
        - **Identified `TypeError: can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes`** in `data.py` filtering logic. Fixed by making ORM `datetime` objects timezone-aware (`.replace(tzinfo=timezone.utc)`) before validation and use.
        - Refactored test data to use a fixed base `datetime` and `timedelta` for predictability, instead of `time.time()`.
        - **Final `AssertionError` related to timestamp mismatch in test:** Realized `.timestamp()` on naive datetimes from SQLite (representing UTC) interprets them as local. Fixed by making these datetimes UTC-aware (`.replace(tzinfo=timezone.utc)`) *within the test code* before calling `.timestamp()` for expected value calculation.
- User requested review and a new rule for `CRITICAL_RULES.md` regarding logging and permissions.
- Updated `TASKS.md` (6.0, 6.4 done).
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` and `VERSION_COUNTER.txt` to 19.
- Added requested rule to `project_guidelines/CRITICAL_RULES.md`.
- Re-read project guidelines.

## [Session 23] - 2025-05-21

**Development:**
- **Task 6.5.1 (Backend Unit & Integration Tests - API Endpoints):**
    - Added tests for Redis interactions in `/data/klines/{symbol:path}/{timeframe}` API (`test_data_api.py`):
        - `test_get_klines_from_redis_cache`: Verifies fetching from Redis when data is available in cache.
        - `test_get_klines_from_redis_and_db`: Verifies correct merging and ordering of data from Redis and DB.
        - `test_get_klines_backfill_status_reporting`: Verifies API reports backfill status from Redis.
    - Created `backend/tests/api/test_websocket_api.py`.
    - Added tests for `/ws/klines/{symbol:path}/{timeframe}` WebSocket API:
        - `test_websocket_kline_updates_happy_path`: Tests connection, subscription, message receiving (mocked from Pub/Sub), ping/pong, and cleanup.
        - `test_websocket_kline_updates_redis_connection_failure`: Tests error handling if initial Redis connection fails.
    - Updated `TASKS.md` to reflect progress on backend API tests.

**Next Steps:**
- Continue with backend testing (Task 6.5.1), focusing on unit/integration tests for the Data Ingestion Service components.
- Implement frontend UX task (6.4.8) for initial data preload notifications.

## [Session 24] - 2025-05-21

**Development:**
- **Task Status Correction:** Corrected `TASKS.md` to accurately reflect the completion of Tasks 6.0, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4 (and their sub-tasks) based on prior work. Noted that the task numbering for testing/documentation (formerly 6.5) shifted to 7.0.
- **Task 7.1 (Backend Unit & Integration Tests - Data Ingestion Service):**
    - Created `backend/tests/data_ingestion_service/test_binance_connector.py` with tests for `BinanceWebSocketManager` covering:
        - Successful connection and message processing.
        - Reconnection logic.
        - Max retries exceeded scenario.
        - Shutdown event handling.
    - Created `backend/tests/data_ingestion_service/test_historical_data_fetcher.py` with tests for `fetch_historical_klines` and `save_historical_klines_to_db`:
        - Successful single-page fetch, API key usage, pagination.
        - Retry logic for rate limits (429/418) and `httpx.RequestError`.
        - Handling of non-retryable HTTP errors (e.g., 400).
        - Mocked tests for `save_historical_klines_to_db` (empty list, success, DB exception).
    - Created `backend/tests/data_ingestion_service/test_main_processor.py` with integration tests for `kline_data_processor`:
        - Success path (DB save, Redis cache, Redis Pub/Sub).
        - DB failure handling (Redis operations skipped).
        - Redis cache update failure handling (logged, Pub/Sub continues).
        - Redis Pub/Sub failure handling (logged).
    - Created `backend/tests/data_ingestion_service/__init__.py`.
    - Marked all sub-tasks for Data Ingestion Service testing as `done` in `TASKS.md`.
    - Task 7.1 is now complete.
- **Task 6.4.8 (Frontend UX: Initial Data Preload Window / No Data Pop-up):**
    - Created `frontend/src/components/ChartStatusPopup.vue` component to display dismissible notifications.
    - Integrated `ChartStatusPopup` into `Home.vue`.
    - Added logic in `Home.vue` to show/hide the popup based on live data availability, backfill status from API, and WebSocket connection states.
    - Task 6.4.8 is now complete.

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed with Task 7.2: Frontend Interaction Testing.
- Then Task 7.3: Performance & Stability Monitoring.
- Finally Task 7.4: Update Project Documentation.

### Action: Task 6.0 - Live Price Data Integration (Binance)
- **Status:** `done`
- **Result:** Implemented the full pipeline for ingesting, storing, caching, and serving live/historical data from Binance.
    - **Infrastructure (Task 6.1):** Dockerized Redis and TimescaleDB successfully set up. `Kline` model created and TimescaleDB hypertable configured. Redis connection utilities established.
    - **Data Ingestion Service (Task 6.2):** 
        - Standalone service in `backend/data_ingestion_service/` created.
        - `BinanceWebSocketManager` initially built with `httpx`, but due to persistent `AttributeError: 'AsyncClient' object has no attribute 'websocket_connect'` (even in isolated envs, suggesting a Python 3.13/system issue), it was refactored to use the `websockets` library. This involved adapting connection logic, ping/pong handling (switching to library-provided keepalive), and message parsing.
        - Historical backfill (`historical_data_fetcher.py`) implemented with rate limit handling.
        - Gap detection and filling logic integrated into the service startup.
        - `kline_data_processor` correctly saves to TimescaleDB (handling `datetime` conversions for `open_time`, `close_time`), updates Redis cache (using float timestamps for scores), and publishes to Redis Pub/Sub.
    - **Backend API (Task 6.3):**
        - Historical Kline API (`/data/klines/{symbol}/{timeframe}`) implemented, fetching from Redis cache and TimescaleDB, and reporting backfill status.
        - Live Kline WebSocket API (`/ws/klines/{symbol}/{timeframe}`) implemented, relaying messages from Redis Pub/Sub to frontend clients, including subscription confirmation and ping/pong with backend.
    - **Frontend Integration (Task 6.4):**
        - Chart mode switching (`Live` vs. `Custom`) implemented in `Home.vue` and Vuex.
        - Historical data is fetched paginated when panning left in live mode.
        - Live kline updates are received via WebSocket and update the chart.
        - UI indicators for data loading and backfill status are present.
        - Resolved numerous frontend issues related to data transformation (API objects to chart arrays), `datetime` vs. timestamp mismatches, and ensuring `DataCube` updates correctly for live data and historical prepends.
        - Addressed chart focal point issues during historical data loading: initial load defaults to latest data, prepending older data attempts to maintain user's view by restoring visible duration.
- **Current Challenge (Relates to Task 4.3 refinement & 7.2 Testing):**
    - When uploading custom signals (`.csv`) while in "Live" chart mode:
        - Signals initially appear for a split second then disappear, or don't appear at all, or cause the chart to zoom out completely.
        - Multiple attempts to fix this by adjusting how `ADD_SIGNALS` mutation (in `frontend/src/store/modules/chart.js`) updates `state.chartDataCube.onchart` and how `Home.vue` triggers chart refresh (using `_debug_id`, `resetChart(false)`, or capturing/restoring view range) have yielded partial or unstable results.
        - The core issue seems to be the interaction between direct `onchart` array mutation, `trading-vue-js` reactivity to its `DataCube` prop (especially when `_debug_id` changes), and live kline updates potentially interfering or causing re-renders that don't preserve the signals or the viewport as expected.

### Action: Task 7.5 - Frontend Performance Optimization (`Trades.vue`)
to - **Status:** `done`
- **Date:** 2025-05-21 (approximately, based on conversation flow)
- **Goal:** Optimize the rendering performance of the "Trades" signal overlay.
- **Issue:** Laggy chart panning and zooming, especially when many signals were displayed.
- **Solution (`frontend/src/trading-vue-core/components/overlays/Trades.vue`):**
    1.  **Horizontal Culling:** Added logic to the `draw()` method to calculate the screen X-coordinate of each signal marker. If the marker is outside the visible canvas width (`layout.width`), its drawing is skipped. A small buffer (`this.marker_size`) is considered to avoid clipping markers at the edges.
    2.  **Zoom-Dependent Label Rendering:**
        - Labels associated with signals are now only drawn if the `layout.px_step` (representing the current width of a single candle in pixels) is greater than a configurable threshold (`this.sett.labelCandleWidthThreshold || 5`).
        - This prevents the performance overhead of drawing many small, overlapping labels when the chart is zoomed out.
- **Result:** Significant improvement in chart responsiveness during panning and zooming when signals are present.
- **Next:** Update project documentation (`DIARY.md`, `README.md`, `DOCUMENTATION.md`).

## [Session 25] - 2025-05-21 (Evening)

**Project Planning:**
- Discussed and prioritized next features for MVP completion within a tight 3-day deadline: "Quick Look" News Sentiment and "My First Watchlist".
- Decided to use `marketaux` for news API (leveraging its built-in sentiment) and to mock/simplify other aspects to meet the deadline.
- Detailed tasks for "Quick Look" News Feature (Task 8.0 in `TASKS.md`) defined, including `image_url` in the `NewsArticle` model and plans for backend (DB model, polling service, API endpoint) and frontend (toggle button, news panel component, data display) development.

## [v0.1.5] - 2025-05-21
### Fixed
- Corrected `news.router` prefix in `backend/app/main.py` to resolve 404 errors for the news API.
- Added `MARKETAUX_API_TOKEN` to Pydantic `Settings` in `backend/app/config.py` to allow news fetcher service to load API key.

### Changed
- Refactored `NewsPanel.vue` to use a new Vuex module (`store/modules/news.js`) for state management (articles, loading, error).
- News articles are now cleared from the store when the `NewsPanel` is closed, ensuring fresh data is loaded when switching symbols or reopening.
- Article images in `NewsPanel.vue` are now clickable hyperlinks to the original article.

### Improved
- News fetching logic in `news_fetcher_service/main.py` reviewed against Marketaux API for correct field parsing (snippet, published_at, sentiment) and recency.

### Action: Task 8.0 - "Quick Look" News Panel Feature Development (In Progress)
- **Status:** `in_progress`
- **Date:** 2025-05-21 (approximate, reflecting recent work)
- **Goal:** Implement a panel to display recent news articles with sentiment for the selected financial asset.
- **Key Implementation Steps & Current Status:**
    1.  **API Selection & Setup:**
        - Selected `marketaux` for news data and its built-in sentiment analysis.
        - Registered for an API key and added `MARKETAUX_API_TOKEN` to the root `.env` file.
    2.  **Backend Development (Task 8.1 - `in_progress`):**
        - **Database (Task QL.B1 - `done`):**
            - Defined `NewsArticle` SQLAlchemy model in `backend/app/models.py` (including `id`, `external_article_id`, `symbol`, `headline`, `snippet`, `source_name`, `article_url`, `image_url`, `published_at`, `sentiment_score_external`, `sentiment_category_derived`, `fetched_at`, `updated_at`).
            - Generated and successfully applied Alembic migration `941c73ffbd8c_add_news_articles_table.py` to create the `news_articles` table.
        - **News Polling Service (Task QL.B2 - `in_progress`):**
            - Created `backend/news_fetcher_service/main.py`.
            - Implemented logic to periodically fetch news from `marketaux` for `SYMBOLS_TO_TRACK` (using `CRYPTO_SYMBOLS_MARKETAUX` mapping).
            - Logic includes parsing response, mapping sentiment score to category ("Positive"/"Negative"/"Neutral"), and saving to `news_articles` table (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` on `external_article_id`).
            - Added `MARKETAUX_API_TOKEN` field to the `Settings` Pydantic model in `backend/app/config.py` to resolve an `AttributeError` when the service tried to load the token.
            - **Current Issue:** The news fetched by the service is very old, has a generic description ("Search field Entering text into the input field will update the search result below"), and neutral sentiment (0.0). This indicates the API query parameters or data parsing in `news_fetcher_service/main.py` needs to be corrected to fetch relevant, recent news.
        - **API Endpoint (Task QL.B3 - `done`):**
            - Created `backend/app/routers/news.py` with a `GET /api/news/{symbol}` endpoint.
            - Defined `NewsArticleRead` Pydantic schema in `backend/app/schemas.py`.
            - Endpoint queries the DB for the latest N articles for a given symbol, ordered by `published_at` descending.
            - Registered the news router in `backend/app/main.py`.
            - **Resolved 404 Error:** Fixed an issue where the news API endpoint was returning a 404 error due to a double prefix (`/api/api/news/...`). This was corrected by removing `prefix="/api"` from `app.include_router(news.router, ...)` in `main.py` as the router itself already included `/api/news` in its prefix.
    3.  **Frontend Development (Task 8.2 - `in_progress`):**
        - **Toggle Button & Panel State (Task QL.F1 - `done`):**
            - Added a "News" toggle button to `frontend/src/views/Home.vue`, visible to logged-in users.
            - This button controls a `showNewsPanel` data property.
            - Debugged and fixed an issue where the "News" button wasn't appearing due to a mismatch in Vuex getter names for `isAuthenticated` and `currentUser` between `Home.vue` and `auth.js` store module. Corrected names in `Home.vue`.
        - **`NewsPanel.vue` Component (Task QL.F2 - `done`):**
            - Created `frontend/src/components/NewsPanel.vue`.
            - Component is conditionally rendered in `Home.vue` based on `showNewsPanel`.
            - Styled as a right sidebar with a title and a close button.
        - **Fetch & Display News (Task QL.F3 - `done`):**
            - `NewsPanel.vue` accepts `currentChartSymbol` as a prop.
            - On becoming visible or when the symbol changes, it fetches data from `/api/news/{symbol}` via a Vuex action in the `news` module (`frontend/src/store/modules/news.js`).
            - Displays articles including image preview (from `image_url`), a clickable headline (linking to `article_url`), source name, formatted `published_at`, and a visual cue for the sentiment category.
            - Handles loading and error states.
            - **Vuex `news` Module:** Created to manage news articles, loading status, and errors. Articles are cleared from the store when the panel is closed to ensure fresh data on next open/symbol change.
            - **Display Issue Fix:** Resolved a problem where `NewsPanel.vue` showed "No news available" despite data being fetched. The root cause was an inconsistency in the Vuex `news` module state property naming (`articles` vs. `newsArticles`). Corrected to `newsArticles` for consistent reactive updates.
        - **Live Status & Refresh (Task QL.F4 - `to_do`):**
            - Functionality to display "Last updated" time, show a warning for stale news, and a manual "Refresh" button is pending.
- **Overall Progress:** Backend infrastructure for news is largely in place, and the frontend panel can display data. The critical blocker is the data quality from the `news_fetcher_service`.
- **Next Steps (for news feature):**
    1.  Debug and fix `news_fetcher_service/main.py` to ensure it fetches recent, relevant news from `marketaux` with correct headlines, snippets, URLs, images, and sentiment scores. This will likely involve reviewing Marketaux API documentation for appropriate query parameters (e.g., for sorting by date, filtering by recency, language, etc.).
    2.  Implement QL.F4 for frontend news panel enhancements.

### Action: UI Refinement - NewsPanel Sentiment Tags (Frontend)
- **Status:** `done`
- **Result:**
    - Refined the styling of sentiment tags in `frontend/src/components/NewsPanel.vue` for a more polished "pill" appearance.
    - Adjusted CSS for `.sentiment-tag`: `padding` changed to `3px 8px` and `border-radius` to `12px`.
    - Confirmed that the `getSentimentDisplayText` method already correctly adds a space before the score parenthesis for "Neutral" sentiment, so no change was needed there.
- **Next:** This completes the planned UI refinements for the news sentiment display. Proceed with next user-requested task or new feature development.

### Action: Implement Auto-Refresh for NewsPanel (Frontend)
- **Status:** `done`
- **Result:**
    - Modified `frontend/src/components/NewsPanel.vue` to implement an automatic news refresh mechanism.
    - When the panel is visible and a symbol is selected, a timer is started to fetch news every 6 minutes.
    - The timer is appropriately cleared when the panel is hidden, the symbol changes (restarting the timer for the new symbol), or the component is destroyed.
    - The "Updated:" timestamp in the panel's footer will now reflect the time of the latest successful fetch (manual or automatic).
    - Added `newsRefreshIntervalId` to `data`, and new methods `startNewsRefreshTimer` and `stopNewsRefreshTimer`.
    - Updated `watch` for `show` and `symbol`, `handleClosePanel` method, and `beforeDestroy` lifecycle hook to manage the timer.
- **Next:** Monitor functionality and proceed with next user-requested tasks.

### Action: Update `TASKS.md` for New Perflogs Feature (Task 9.0)
- **Status:** `done`
- **Date:** 2025-05-22
- **Result:**
    - Reviewed the existing `TASKS.md` content.
    - Replaced the previous Task 9.0 ("My First Watchlist") with the new "Perflogs (Performance Logs Backtesting)" feature.
    - Added detailed sub-tasks for backend development (PL.B1-PL.B4: DB Model & Migration, Pydantic Schemas, CRUD Operations, API Endpoints for `TradeNote`).
    - Added detailed sub-tasks for frontend development (PL.F1-PL.F5: Vuex Module, `PerflogsPanel.vue`, `TradeNoteCard.vue`, `AddTradeNoteForm.vue`, Integration into `Home.vue`).
    - Added sub-tasks for styling and refinements (PL.S1-PL.S2: Styling Perflogs Components, Smooth Transitions).
    - Included references to `@mockup_perflogs_main_page.png` and `@mockup_perflogs_new_note.png` in relevant frontend UI tasks for design guidance.
    - Added a new Task 10.0 for "Final Testing & Documentation Update (Post-Perflogs)" to ensure dedicated follow-up.
    - The updated tasks are now comprehensive and ready for development.
- **Next:** Proceeding with Perflogs development, starting with Task PL.B1.

### Action: Task PL.B1 - Define `TradeNote` DB Model & Migration (Perflogs)
- **Status:** `done`
- **Date:** 2025-05-22
- **Result:**
    - Defined `TradeDirectionEnum` (LONG, SHORT) in `backend/app/models.py`.
    - Defined `TradeNote` SQLAlchemy model in `backend/app/models.py` with fields: `id`, `user_id`, `asset_ticker`, `timeframe`, `trade_direction`, `entry_price`, `exit_price`, `margin`, `leverage`, `pnl`, `note_text`, `created_at`, `updated_at`. Ensured appropriate data types (Numeric for prices/financials, Text for notes, ForeignKey for `user_id`, SQLAlchemyEnum for `trade_direction`).
    - Generated Alembic revision: `alembic revision -m create_tradenotes_table_and_tradedirectionenum_type --autogenerate` (command run from `backend/` dir, using `.venv/bin/alembic`).
    - Migration file `backend/alembic/versions/64cf476d46db_create_tradenotes_table_and_.py` was generated.
    - Manually adjusted the migration script to explicitly create the PostgreSQL ENUM type `tradedirectionenum` using `PgEnum(...).create(op.get_bind(), checkfirst=True)` in `upgrade()` and `PgEnum(...).drop(op.get_bind(), checkfirst=True)` in `downgrade()` for proper Alembic handling, consistent with `subscriptionplanenum`.
    - Successfully applied the migration: `alembic upgrade head` (command run from `backend/` dir, using `.venv/bin/alembic`).
    - The `tradenotes` table and `tradedirectionenum` type are now created in the database.
- **Next:** Proceed with Task PL.B2: Pydantic Schemas for `TradeNote`.

### Action: Task PL.B2 - Define Pydantic Schemas for `TradeNote` (Perflogs)
- **Status:** `done`
- **Date:** 2025-05-22
- **Result:**
    - Added `TradeNoteBase`, `TradeNoteCreate`, and `TradeNoteRead` Pydantic schemas to `backend/app/schemas.py`.
    - Imported `Decimal` and `TradeDirectionEnum`.
    - `TradeNoteBase` includes common fields with validation (asset_ticker, timeframe, trade_direction, entry_price, exit_price, margin, leverage, pnl, note_text).
    - `TradeNoteCreate` inherits from `TradeNoteBase`.
    - `TradeNoteRead` inherits from `TradeNoteBase` and adds `id`, `user_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
    - Configured `json_encoders` in `TradeNoteBase` for `Decimal` to `float`, and in `TradeNoteRead` for `Decimal` to `float` and `datetime` to millisecond integer timestamps.
- **Next:** Proceed with Task PL.B3: Implement CRUD Operations for `TradeNote`.

### Action: Task PL.B3 - Implement CRUD Operations for `TradeNote` (Perflogs)
- **Status:** `done`
- **Date:** 2025-05-22
- **Result:**
    - Added CRUD functions to `backend/app/crud.py` for `TradeNote`:
        - `create_trade_note(db: Session, trade_note: schemas.TradeNoteCreate, user_id: int)`: Creates a new trade note.
        - `get_trade_notes_by_user_and_asset(db: Session, user_id: int, asset_ticker: str, skip: int = 0, limit: int = 100)`: Retrieves trade notes for a user and asset, ordered by `created_at` desc, with pagination.
        - `get_trade_note_by_id(db: Session, trade_note_id: int, user_id: int)`: Retrieves a specific trade note by ID, ensuring user ownership.
        - `delete_trade_note(db: Session, trade_note_id: int, user_id: int)`: Deletes a specific trade note by ID, ensuring user ownership, and returns the deleted note.
- **Next:** Proceed with Task PL.B4: Create API Endpoints for `TradeNote`.

### Action: Task PL.B4 - Create API Endpoints for `TradeNote` (Perflogs)
- **Status:** `done`
- **Date:** 2025-05-22
- **Result:**
    - Created `backend/app/routers/perflogs.py` with the following authenticated API endpoints:
        - `POST /perflogs/notes/`: Creates a new trade note for the current user.
        - `GET /perflogs/notes/{asset_ticker}`: Retrieves trade notes for the current user and specified asset ticker (with pagination).
        - `DELETE /perflogs/notes/{trade_note_id}`: Deletes a specific trade note if owned by the current user.
    - Registered the new `perflogs_router` in `backend/app/main.py`.
- **Next:** Update documentation (`TASKS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `DIARY.md`), increment version, and then proceed to Perflogs Frontend (PL.F1).

### Action: Task PL.F1 - Create Vuex Module for Perflogs (Frontend)
- **Status:** `done`
- **Date:** 2025-05-22
- **Result:**
    - Created `frontend/src/store/modules/perflogs.js` containing:
        - State: `tradeNotes`, `isLoading`, `error`, `currentAssetTicker`, `currentAssetTimeframe`.
        - Mutations: `SET_TRADE_NOTES`, `ADD_TRADE_NOTE`, `REMOVE_TRADE_NOTE`, `SET_LOADING`, `SET_ERROR`, `CLEAR_PERFLOGS_DATA`, `SET_CURRENT_ASSET_CONTEXT`.
        - Actions: `fetchTradeNotes`, `submitTradeNote`, `deleteTradeNote` (all interacting with backend API and using auth token), `clearPerflogsData`, `setCurrentAssetContext`.
        - Getters: `getTradeNotesSorted`, `getTotalPnl`, `getDateRange`, `isLoadingPerflogs`, `perflogsError`, `currentPerflogAsset`, `currentPerflogTimeframe`.
    - Registered the `perflogs` module in `frontend/src/store/index.js`.
- **Next:** Proceed with Task PL.F2: Implement `PerflogsPanel.vue` component.

### Action: Task PL.F2 - Implement `PerflogsPanel.vue` Component (Frontend)
- **Status:** `done`
- **Date:** 2025-05-22
- **Result:**
    - Created `frontend/src/components/PerflogsPanel.vue`.
    - The component is designed as a right sidebar.
    - It connects to the `perflogs` Vuex module to display:
        - Dynamic title with the current asset ticker.
        - Overall P&L and date range of recorded notes.
        - Loading and error states.
    - Includes an "Add Note" button (which will toggle the form later) and a placeholder list for `TradeNoteCard.vue` components.
    - Implements watchers to fetch trade notes when the panel is shown or the `currentAssetTicker` changes.
    - Clears Vuex perflogs data and resets internal form state when the panel is closed (via `closePanel` emitting `close-panel` event).
    - Basic styling is applied, aiming for a dark theme consistent with a trading application.
    - Encountered ESLint errors during creation, attempted a fix which was not applied by the edit tool. Proceeding with the understanding that minor stylistic lint errors might persist.
- **Next:** Proceed with Task PL.F3: Implement `TradeNoteCard.vue` component.

### Action: Task PL.F3 - Implement `TradeNoteCard.vue` Component (Frontend)
- **Status:** `done`
- **Date:** 2025-05-22
- **Result:**
    - Created `frontend/src/components/TradeNoteCard.vue`.
    - This component accepts a `note` object as a prop.
    - Displays trade details: asset ticker, timeframe, direction (with specific styling for long/short), entry/exit prices, margin, leverage, P&L (styled for positive/negative), and created/updated dates.
    - Includes a delete button which, on confirmation, dispatches the `deleteTradeNote` Vuex action.
    - Implements a "Read More" / "Read Less" functionality for the `note_text` if it exceeds a preview length.
    - Basic styling applied for a card-like appearance within the dark theme.
    - Updated `PerflogsPanel.vue` to import and use `TradeNoteCard.vue` for rendering the list of notes, replacing the previous placeholder.
    - Encountered ESLint errors during creation of both components; automatic fixes were not successfully applied by the edit tool. These stylistic issues may need manual correction later.
- **Next:** Proceed with Task PL.F4: Implement `AddTradeNoteForm.vue` component.

### Action: Task PL.F4 - Implement `AddTradeNoteForm.vue` Component (Frontend)
- **Status:** `done`
- **Date:** 2025-05-22
- **Result:**
    - Created the Vue component for adding new trade notes.
    - Includes fields for direction, entry/exit price, margin, leverage, and optional note text.
    - Implemented client-side P&L calculation based on form inputs.
    - Handles character limits for note text.
    - Submits form data via Vuex action `perflogs/submitTradeNote`.
    - Manages submission state (loading, error) and provides user feedback.
    - Resets form on successful submission or cancellation.
    - Auto-fills asset ticker and timeframe from Vuex state (set by `PerflogsPanel`).
    - Styled for consistency with the dark theme.
    - Integrated into `PerflogsPanel.vue` for conditional rendering when the user clicks "Add Note".

### Action: Task PL.F5 - Integrate Perflogs into `Home.vue` (Frontend)
- **Status:** `done`
- **Date:** 2025-05-22
- **Result:**
    - Imported and registered the `PerflogsPanel.vue` component.
    - Added a `showPerflogsPanel` data property to control its visibility.
    - Added a "Perflogs" toggle button to the user controls in the header (visible if authenticated).
    - Conditionally rendered the `<perflogs-panel>` component, binding its `show` prop and handling the `@close-panel` event.
    - Implemented logic in `togglePerflogsPanel` (and a new `openPerflogsPanel` helper) to dispatch the `perflogs/setCurrentAssetContext` Vuex action with the current chart's `assetTicker` (from `currentDisplaySymbol`) and `timeframe` (from a new `currentDisplayTimeframe` computed property) before showing the panel.
    - The `currentDisplayTimeframe` computed property was added to reliably provide the timeframe for both 'live' and 'custom' chart modes.
    - If no asset is selected, a warning popup is shown, and the panel is not opened.

**Backend Fixes (Recap from prior to PL.F4/F5):**
*   Corrected `leverage: Decimal = Field(..., ge=1.0, default=1.0)` to `leverage: Decimal = Field(default=1.0, ge=1.0)` in `TradeNoteBase` schema (`backend/app/schemas.py`) to resolve a `TypeError`.

**Linting Issues:**
*   Encountered and attempted to fix ESLint errors in `AddTradeNoteForm.vue` and `PerflogsPanel.vue`. Some minor formatting issues persisted in `Home.vue` related to a multi-line function call, which will be monitored but not blocking for now.

**Next Steps:**
*   PL.C1: Commit all recent Perflogs feature changes (backend and frontend) to the Git repository.
*   Thorough testing of the entire Perflogs UI flow.
*   Address any remaining styling inconsistencies or minor bugs.
*   Begin work on PL.D: Perflogs Documentation & Deployment (updating `DOCUMENTATION.md`).

**Blockers:**
*   None currently.

**Notes:**
*   The project's main documentation files (`TASKS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`) have been updated to reflect the completion of PL.F4 and PL.F5.

### Action: Task 9.0 (PL.F) - Perflogs Frontend Implementation - UI Styling & Finalization
- **Status:** `done`
- **Result:**
    - **Icon Visibility (Font Awesome):**
        - Diagnosed missing icons (trash, close) due to Font Awesome not being loaded.
        - Added Font Awesome 5 CDN link to `frontend/public/index.html` to enable icon rendering across the application.
        - Ensured `TradeNoteCard.vue` delete icon (`fas fa-trash-alt`) and `PerflogsPanel.vue` close icon (`fas fa-times`) use correct Font Awesome classes and are styled to be white/light gray.
    - **`PerflogsPanel.vue` Styling and UX Refinements:**
        - **Close Button:** Styled as a white 'X' icon in the top-right corner.
        - **Summary Section:** Ensured the P&L summary section has rounded corners and a border consistent with `TradeNoteCard` styling. Adjusted internal padding and margins for visual consistency.
        - **Width Consistency:** Ensured the summary section, "Add Note" button, and trade note cards maintain consistent width within the panel by applying `width: 100%` and `box-sizing: border-box` to relevant elements and their containers.
        - **Data Clearing:** Enhanced logic in `watch`ers for `show` and `assetTicker` to robustly clear Perflogs data (notes, P&L) and hide the "Add Note" form when the panel is closed, opened with an invalid/N.A. ticker, or when the chart's asset context changes. This provides a clean slate for the new context.
        - **"Add Note" Button State:** Confirmed and refined the `:disabled` binding on the "Add Note" button to be inactive when `assetTicker` is 'N/A' or null, or when data is loading.
        - **"No Trade Notes" Message:** Styled the "No trade notes recorded for this asset yet." message in `PerflogsPanel.vue` to match the orange warning pop-up theme (light orange background, orange left border) for better visual feedback.
        - **Zero PNL Display:** Modified `formattedTotalPnl` computed property in `PerflogsPanel.vue` so that a total P&L of zero is displayed as "0.00 USD" without a preceding '+' sign and using the default text color (neutral).
    - **`TradeNoteCard.vue` Styling:**
        - Delete icon background made transparent, with a red background appearing on hover for better UX.
        - Addressed a persistent linter warning regarding `rgba()` formatting (noted as a stylistic preference of the linter).
- **Next:** Update `CHANGELOG.md` and `TASKS.md`. Mark Perflogs Task 9.0 as complete.

### Action: Task 9.0 (Perflogs) - Frontend UI Refinements & Bug Fixes (Continued)
- **Status:** `done`
- **Result:**
    - **News Panel - Data Clearing Logic:**
        - Modified `frontend/src/views/Home.vue` to dispatch `news/clearNews` Vuex action when switching chart modes (Live/Custom). This ensures news is cleared when the chart's fundamental data source type changes.
        - The existing logic in `frontend/src/components/NewsPanel.vue` (clearing news on symbol change if panel is open, or on panel close) remains to handle other scenarios.
    - **News Panel - Dark Theme Styling:**
        - Applied a dark theme to `frontend/src/components/NewsPanel.vue` to match the styling of `PerflogsPanel.vue`.
        - This included updating background colors, text colors, borders, button styles, sentiment tag appearance, and scrollbar styles for a consistent look and feel.
        - Addressed minor linter warnings related to spacing in the `<style>` block of `NewsPanel.vue`.
- **Next:** Update `CHANGELOG.md`.

## 2025-05-24

**Actions & Changes:**

*   **Task 11 - Interactive Asset/Timeframe & Context Management (Fixes & Refinements):**
    *   Resolved issue where chart data failed to reload after asset/timeframe context changes. Ensured `fetchInitialHistoricalKlines` is correctly triggered in `Home.vue` after data clearing.
    *   Refined `Home.vue` context change watcher (`currentContextIdentifier`) to only trigger News/Perflogs data refresh when the actual asset changes, not just the timeframe.
    *   Fixed ESLint `no-unused-vars` error in `chart.js` Vuex module by removing the unused `changed` variable in the `setLastLiveAssetAndTimeframe` action.
*   **UI Enhancements & Layout - `Home.vue`:**
    *   Restructured top navigation bar to a consistent two-section layout:
        *   **Left Section (`mode-asset-controls`):** "Home" link (styled), `AssetTimeframeSelector`, "Live/Custom Chart" buttons.
        *   **Right Section (`user-controls`):** "News" toggle, "Perflogs" toggle, user greeting, "Log out" button (styling restored), and a new conditional "Log in" button (styled blue) for unauthenticated users.
    *   Corrected element placements to achieve the desired layout.
*   **Browser Tab Title:**
    *   Updated the HTML title in `frontend/public/index.html` to "InCharts".
*   **Documentation:**
    *   Updated `DOCUMENTATION.md` to reflect the `Home.vue` layout modifications, the new "Log in" button, and the browser tab title change.

**Observations & Notes:**

*   The interactive asset/timeframe selection should now be more robust, with correct data loading for the chart and more targeted updates for auxiliary panels like News and Perflogs.
*   The top bar layout in `Home.vue` is now more organized and caters to both authenticated and unauthenticated states.

**Next Steps:**

*   Verify completion of Task 11.
*   Proceed with Frontend Interaction Testing (Task 7.2) or other pending high-priority tasks.

## [Session 26] - 2025-05-24 (Evening)

**Development:**
- **Task 12.0 - Real-time Current Candle Updates (Live Ticks):**
    - **Task 12.1.1: Research Binance WebSocket Streams for Live Ticks - `done`**
        - Researched Binance WebSocket API documentation.
        - Determined that the existing Kline/Candlestick Streams (`<symbol>@kline_<interval>`) are suitable. These streams provide updates to the current, unclosed candle (when `k.x` in the payload is `false`), with update speeds of ~250ms (futures) to 1-2s (spot).
        - This approach avoids the complexity of subscribing to a separate `@aggTrade` stream and manually constructing candles from individual trades.
        - The strategy will be to refine the existing kline data processing to handle these unclosed kline updates for real-time tick effects.
    - **Task 12.1.2: Modify `BinanceWebSocketManager` to pass unclosed klines - `done`**
        - Modified `_parse_kline_message` in `backend/data_ingestion_service/binance_connector.py`.
        - The method now parses and returns kline data whether it's closed (`k.x: true`) or an update to the unclosed candle (`k.x: false`).
        - The `is_closed` status is included in the parsed dictionary, allowing downstream processors to differentiate.
    - **Tasks 12.1.3, 12.1.4, 12.1.5: Modify `kline_data_processor` for Dual Handling & Tick Publishing - `done`**
        - Updated `kline_data_processor` in `backend/data_ingestion_service/main.py`.
        - If kline `is_closed` is true: existing logic for DB save, Redis cache, and Pub/Sub (message type `kline_closed`) is used. Corrected Redis ZSET trimming.
        - If kline `is_closed` is false (tick update): a kline object representing the current state of the forming candle is constructed and published to the same Redis Pub/Sub channel (`kline_updates:<symbol>:<timeframe>`) but with message type `kline_tick`.
    - **Task 12.1.6: Integration into Ingestion Service Main Loop - `done`**
        - Verified that the existing main loop in `backend/data_ingestion_service/main.py` correctly launches `BinanceWebSocketManager` instances.
        - The modifications in 12.1.2 and 12.1.3-5 ensure that these managers now source and process data for both closed klines and live tick updates without needing changes to the main service loop itself.
    - **Task 12.2.1: Modify Backend WebSocket API to relay new tick messages - `done`**
        - Reviewed the existing backend WebSocket endpoint (`/ws/klines/{symbol}/{timeframe}` in `backend/app/routers/data.py`).
        - The current implementation already forwards the raw JSON string message from Redis Pub/Sub.
        - Since the data ingestion service now publishes payloads like `{"type": "kline_tick", "data": ...}` or `{"type": "kline_closed", "data": ...}`, the backend API requires no changes to relay these distinct messages.
        - The differentiation will be handled by the frontend client upon receiving and parsing the WebSocket message.
    - **Task 12.2.2 & 12.2.3: Vuex Logic for Live Tick Updates - `done`**
        - Added `PROCESS_LIVE_KLINE_TICK` mutation and `processLiveKlineTick` action to `frontend/src/store/modules/chart.js`.
        - The mutation correctly updates the `liveChartDataCube` by either modifying the last kline or appending a new one based on the incoming tick's `open_time`.
        - It parses string numbers from the tick data and ensures reactivity by creating a new `DataCube` instance, preserving overlays.
        - Addressed ESLint formatting issues.
    - **Task 12.2.1 (Frontend Part): Modify Frontend WebSocket Handler for Ticks - `done`**
        - Updated the `livePriceSocket.onmessage` handler in `frontend/src/views/Home.vue`.
        - It now parses the incoming WebSocket message, checks the `type` field (`kline_closed` or `kline_tick`), and dispatches the appropriate Vuex action (`updateLiveKline` or `processLiveKlineTick`) with the `data` payload.
        - Addressed ESLint formatting issues.

**Next Steps:**
- Task 12.2.4: Chart Reactivity and Performance (Manual testing and monitoring post-deployment of these changes).
- Consider committing changes to Git.
- Proceed with general testing (Task 7.2, 7.3) and other pending tasks.

### Action: Task 12.0 - Real-time Current Candle Updates (Live Ticks)
- **Status:** `done` (except for Task 12.2.4: Chart Reactivity and Performance - pending manual testing)
- **Date:** 2025-05-24
- **Goal:** Modify the data ingestion pipeline and frontend to display real-time price ticks, dynamically updating the current (unclosed) candle on the chart.
- **Result:**
    - **Backend (Data Ingestion Service & API - Task 12.1):**
        - **12.1.1 (Research):** Confirmed Binance Kline/Candlestick streams (`<symbol>@kline_<interval>`) are suitable as they provide updates for unclosed klines (identified by `k.x: false` in the payload).
        - **12.1.2 (Binance Connector):** Modified `_parse_kline_message` in `backend/data_ingestion_service/binance_connector.py` to parse and return kline data regardless of the `k.x` (is_closed) flag, including the `is_closed` status in its output dictionary.
        - **12.1.3 - 12.1.5 (Kline Processor):** Updated `kline_data_processor` in `backend/data_ingestion_service/main.py`:
            - If `is_closed` is true (final kline): Existing logic is used (save to TimescaleDB, update Redis ZSET cache `klines:<symbol>:<timeframe>`, publish to Redis Pub/Sub `kline_updates:<symbol>:<timeframe>` with `type: "kline_closed"`). The Redis ZSET trimming logic was also corrected to properly maintain the `MAX_KLINES_IN_REDIS` newest entries.
            - If `is_closed` is false (tick update for unclosed kline): A kline object representing the current state of the forming candle is constructed. This tick data is then published to the same Redis Pub/Sub channel (`kline_updates:<symbol>:<timeframe>`) but with a distinct message structure: `{"type": "kline_tick", "data": {...tick_kline_object...}}`.
        - **12.1.6 (Ingestion Loop Integration):** Verified that the existing main loop in `backend/data_ingestion_service/main.py` requires no changes, as the modified `BinanceWebSocketManager` and `kline_data_processor` seamlessly handle the new dual-type kline processing.
    - **Backend (API - Task 12.2.1 - Backend part):**
        - Reviewed the backend WebSocket API endpoint (`/ws/klines/{symbol}/{timeframe}` in `backend/app/routers/data.py`). Confirmed that it already relays raw JSON strings from Redis Pub/Sub. No changes were needed, as it will now naturally relay both `{"type": "kline_closed", ...}` and `{"type": "kline_tick", ...}` messages.
    - **Frontend (Vuex & Home.vue - Task 12.2):**
        - **12.2.2 & 12.2.3 (Vuex `chart.js`):**
            - Added a new mutation `PROCESS_LIVE_KLINE_TICK` and a corresponding action `processLiveKlineTick`.
            - The `PROCESS_LIVE_KLINE_TICK` mutation updates the `liveChartDataCube` (which holds live kline data for the chart). It intelligently handles the incoming tick data:
                - If the tick's `open_time` matches the last kline in the `liveChartDataCube`, it updates that last kline's values (high, low, close, volume).
                - If the tick's `open_time` is newer (indicating a new candle has started forming since the last *closed* kline was received), it appends a new kline array representing this forming candle.
                - Ensures numeric string values from the tick payload are correctly parsed to numbers.
                - Critically, it creates a new `DataCube` instance (passing existing `onchart` and `offchart` overlays) to ensure Vue's reactivity updates the chart. Addressed ESLint errors.
        - **12.2.1 (Frontend WebSocket Handler in `Home.vue`):**
            - Updated the `livePriceSocket.onmessage` event handler in `frontend/src/views/Home.vue`.
            - The handler now parses the incoming JSON message from the WebSocket.
            - It checks the `type` field in the parsed message.
            - If `type` is `"kline_closed"`, it dispatches the existing `chart/updateLiveKline` action with `message.data`.
            - If `type` is `"kline_tick"`, it dispatches the new `chart/processLiveKlineTick` action with `message.data`.
            - Addressed ESLint errors.
    - **Task 12.2.4 (Chart Reactivity/Performance):** This sub-task is marked as `to_do` and requires manual testing by the user to observe the chart's behavior with live ticks and assess performance.
- **Git Commit:** All changes for Task 12.0 were successfully committed with the message "feat: Implement real-time current candle updates (live ticks)".
- **Next Steps (as per user agreement):** User to perform manual testing for Task 7.2 (Frontend Interaction Testing) and Task 7.3 (Performance & Stability Monitoring), with a focus on the new live tick feature (related to Task 12.2.4), before proceeding to other main tasks like Task 10.0.
