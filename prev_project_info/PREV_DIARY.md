# AI Action Diary

## Project Context Summary (as of 2025-05-19 after Alembic Setup - Task 1.6)

**Purpose:** This summary is for the AI assistant (me!) to quickly regain context about the InChart project. Consult this before starting new work or if the conversation resets.

**1. Project Goal:**
   - Build an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of InChart, a trading platform.

**2. Technology Stack:**
   - **Backend:** Python with FastAPI
   - **Database:** PostgreSQL
   - **Database Migration Tool:** Alembic
   - **Frontend:** Vue.js v2 (critically, `trading-vue-js` requires Vue 2)
   - **Key Frontend Library:** `trading-vue-js` for charting.

**3. Key Files & Directories:**
   - **Project Guidelines/Rules:** `docs/project_guidelines/` (contains `TASKS.md`, `DIARY.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `PROJECT_RULES.md`, `TECH_STACK.md`, etc.) and `.cursor/rules/` (contains `cursor_rules.mdc`, `dev_workflow.mdc`, etc.)
   - **Backend Code:** `backend/`
     - **Alembic Migrations:** `backend/alembic/versions/`
   - **Frontend Code:** `frontend/`
   - **Task List:** `docs/project_guidelines/TASKS.md`
   - **This Diary:** `docs/project_guidelines/DIARY.md`
   - **Changelog:** `docs/project_guidelines/CHANGELOG.md`
   - **Version Files:** `VERSION` (e.g., 0.0.1), `VERSION_COUNTER.txt` (integer, currently 13)
   - **Requirements:** `backend/requirements.txt`, `frontend/package.json`
   - **Environment Config:** Root `.env` file (for backend credentials like `DATABASE_URL`).

**4. GitHub Repository Information:**
   - **Username:** `tarasenkofedor`
   - **Repository:** `inchart-v0-inginition`
   - **Main Branch:** `main`
   - **Commit Cadence:** Commit to GitHub after each task or subtask is marked 'done'.

**5. Database Setup & Migrations:**
   - **Type:** PostgreSQL
   - **Credentials:** Managed via root `.env` file (`DATABASE_URL`).
   - **Schema Management:** Alembic is now used for database migrations.
     - `backend/alembic.ini` and `backend/alembic/env.py` are configured.
     - The initial migration creating the `users` table (with `id`, `email`, `nickname`, `hashed_password`, `is_active` and indexes) has been generated and applied (`backend/alembic/versions/a39e46cc5f70_create_user_table_with_nickname.py`).
     - The database schema is now aligned with `backend/app/models.py`. Previously, the `users` table was created directly by SQLAlchemy and lacked the `nickname` column.

**6. Task Management:**
   - Manual task management via `docs/project_guidelines/TASKS.md`.
   - Update `TASKS.md` status, `DIARY.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `VERSION_COUNTER.txt` after each completed task/subtask.

**7. Completed Major Workstreams (So Far):**
   - **Task 1.0 (excluding 1.6): Foundational Setup & User Accounts (Backend)** - FastAPI, initial User model (pre-nickname), basic auth endpoints.
   - **Task 1.6: Database Migrations with Alembic** - Alembic setup and initial migration for `users` table with `nickname`.
   - **Task 2.0: Core Charting Shell (Frontend)** - Vue.js v2, `trading-vue-js` integration.
   - **Task 3.0: Custom Price Data Upload & Display** - Frontend uploader, backend CSV validation, chart update.
   - **Task 3.5: User Authentication UI & Nickname Integration** - Frontend login/register forms updated for nickname, backend auth logic updated for nickname, Vuex store updated. User's nickname displayed in UI.

**8. Current Status & Next Steps:**
   - **Last Completed Task:** 1.6.5 (Apply Initial Alembic Migration). All Alembic setup tasks (1.6.1-1.6.5) are done. The database schema now correctly includes the `nickname` field in the `users` table.
   - **Current `VERSION_COUNTER.txt`:** 13 (to be incremented after this documentation update and commit).
   - **Next Task:** Task 4.0: Custom Signal Data Upload & Display, starting with subtask 4.1 (Frontend UI for Signal Data Upload). The backend should now function correctly with nicknames.
   - **Outstanding Issues from earlier:**
     - Babel linting errors in the frontend (deferred).

**9. Known Issues (from before Alembic):**
   - Persistent Babel Linting Errors in frontend (deferred).

**10. Key Instructions for AI (Myself):**
    - **Autonomy & Proactivity:** Act autonomously to complete tasks.
    - **Documentation:** Meticulously update `TASKS.md`, `DIARY.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `VERSION_COUNTER.txt` after every completed task/subtask.
    - **Commits:** Commit all changes to GitHub (`tarasenkofedor/inchart-v0-inginition`, `main` branch) after each task/subtask completion. Increment `VERSION_COUNTER.txt` for each commit batch.
    - **Context Refresh:** Always consult this `DIARY.md` (especially this summary) and relevant rule files in `docs/project_guidelines/` and `.cursor/rules/` before starting new work or if the conversation flow is interrupted.
    - **Error Handling:** Log errors in `ERROR_LOG.md` (if it exists).
    - **Environment Variables (`.env`):** Root `.env` for backend secrets. Frontend config is in its codebase.

## 2024-05-17

### Action: Update global README.md with project description and attribution
- **Result:** Added InChart project overview, features, tech stack, and attribution to trading-vue-js. Committed to GitHub ([commit link](https://github.com/tarasenkofedor/inchart-v0-inginition/commit/60199b88fb27f6853c41fb47111402a573cb93b7)).

### Action: Create DIARY.md and update rules to require logging after every action
- **Result:** Created this DIARY.md file. Next: update rules to enforce diary logging after each action.

### Action: Add rule to cursor_rules.mdc requiring DIARY.md logging and consultation
- **Result:** Added a rule to .cursor/rules/cursor_rules.mdc that mandates logging every AI action in DIARY.md and consulting it before new actions. This ensures traceability and project memory.

### Action: Add DIARY.md logging rule to llmrules.mdc
- **Result:** Added section 10 to .cursor/rules/llmrules.mdc requiring all AI actions to be logged in DIARY.md and for DIARY.md to be consulted before new actions. This ensures project traceability and context continuity.

### Action: Update memory and rule/file access policy to use only docs/project_guidelines/ files
- **Result:** Will now access and update DIARY.md and all rules files (CRITICAL_RULES.md, PRD.md, PROJECT_RULES.md, QUESTIONS.md, TECH_STACK.md) exclusively from docs/project_guidelines/. All context, rule enforcement, and documentation will be based on these canonical files.

### Action: Create CHANGELOG.md and add rules for changelog, error logging, and diary logging to PROJECT_RULES.md
- **Result:** Created CHANGELOG.md in docs/project_guidelines/ following professional standards. Added rules to PROJECT_RULES.md requiring maintenance of CHANGELOG.md, error logging in ERROR_LOG.md, and mandatory action logging in DIARY.md.

### Action: Implement workflow improvements and add related rules
- **Result:**
    - Confirmed "Commit Before Big Changes" rule exists in `CRITICAL_RULES.md`.
    - Created `VERSION` file, initialized to `0.0.1`.
    - Created `VERSION_COUNTER.txt` file, initialized to `0`.
    - Updated `PROJECT_RULES.md` with new sections for:
        - Version Control and Changelog Management (including GitHub username `tarasenkofedor`, `VERSION` file, `VERSION_COUNTER.txt`, and detailed `CHANGELOG.md` update procedures for dev stages and formal releases).
        - Placeholder rules for future Automated Testing integration (requiring tests and logging results).
        - Placeholder rules for future Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline (GitHub Actions for linting, tests, etc.).
        - Guideline for Regular Log Review (`ERROR_LOG.md`, `DIARY.md`).

### Action: Configure Task Master to use Gemini 2.5 Pro and verify
- **Result:**
    - Set Task Master's main model to `google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25` via OpenRouter.
    - Verification showed the model was set, but the API key status for MCP is `false`. This means the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` needs to be correctly configured in `.cursor/mcp.json` and the MCP server restarted for the `parse_prd` command to use this model via MCP. 

### Action: Re-attempt to generate tasks with Task Master after model reconfiguration
- **Result:** Checked current Task Master model configuration. Main model is `google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25` (via OpenRouter). However, `keyStatus` for MCP is still `false`. User confirmation requested regarding API key setup in `.cursor/mcp.json` and MCP server restart before proceeding with `parse_prd`. 

### Action: Attempt PRD parsing for task generation after API key confirmation
- **Result:** `parse_prd` command failed again with Perplexity "Unauthorized" error, despite main model being set to `google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25` and user confirming API key setup. This suggests a deeper issue with Task Master's model selection for this specific tool via MCP, or persistent API key accessibility problems for MCP. Proposed alternative methods to user (diagnostic `add_task` or manual task synthesis).

### Action: Switch to manual task management and create initial task list
- **Result:**
    - Created `docs/project_guidelines/TASK_RULES.md` with rules for AI task self-management, including status updates, task breakdown, and progress reporting.
    - Updated `docs/project_guidelines/PROJECT_RULES.md` to require AI adherence to and regular consultation of `TASK_RULES.md`.
    - Created `docs/project_guidelines/TASKS.md` and populated it with a detailed, hierarchical list of tasks and subtasks derived from `PRD.md` and `TECH_STACK.md`, covering all MVP features.
    - All tasks in `TASKS.md` are initialized with `pending` status.

### Action: Start Task 1.1 - Backend Project Initialization (FastAPI)
- **Result:** Marked Task 1.1 as `in progress` in `TASKS.md`. Proceeding with creating the FastAPI project structure and initial setup. 

### Action: Complete Task 1.1 - Backend Project Initialization (FastAPI)
- **Result:** Marked Task 1.1 as `done` in `TASKS.md`.
    - Created `backend/` directory structure.
    - Created `backend/app/main.py` with a minimal FastAPI app and header.
    - Created `backend/app/__init__.py` (empty, with header) to make `app` a package.
    - Created `backend/requirements.txt` with initial dependencies.
    - Created `backend/.gitignore`.
    - Updated `VERSION_COUNTER.txt` to `1`.

### Action: Add Critical Rule for Test Coverage
- **Result:** Added a new rule to `docs/project_guidelines/CRITICAL_RULES.md` mandating that every new feature must be accompanied by a corresponding set of tests that validate its core functionality. Tests must pass before a feature is considered complete. 

### Action: Start Task 1.2 - Database Setup (PostgreSQL)
- **Result:** Marked Task 1.2 as `in progress` in `TASKS.md`. Proceeding with defining User model, setting up DB connection, and creating schema. 

### Action: Complete Task 1.2 - Database Setup (PostgreSQL)
- **Result:** Marked Task 1.2 as `done` in `TASKS.md`.
    - Created `backend/app/schemas.py` with Pydantic User/Token models.
    - Created `backend/app/models.py` with SQLAlchemy User model.
    - Updated `backend/requirements.txt` with `SQLAlchemy` and `pydantic`.
    - Created `backend/app/database.py` for DB session management and engine setup (using placeholder DB URL).
    - Updated `backend/app/main.py` to call `create_all` to initialize DB tables.

### Action: Start Task 3.3 - Chart Population with Custom Price Data
- **Result:** Marked Task 3.3 as `in progress` in `TASKS.md`. Proceeding with implementing frontend logic to upload data and update the chart.

### Action: Complete Task 3.3 - Chart Population with Custom Price Data
- **Result:** Marked Task 3.3 as `done` in `TASKS.md`. 
  - Updated `frontend/src/components/PriceDataUploader.vue` to make API calls to `/api/data/upload/price` (via proxy) and emit `price-data-uploaded` event with processed data.
  - Updated `frontend/vue.config.js` to proxy `/api` requests to `http://localhost:8000`.
  - Updated `frontend/src/App.vue` to listen for `price-data-uploaded`, transform data, and pass it to `TradingChart.vue` (using `:key` for re-rendering).
  - Updated `frontend/src/components/TradingChart.vue` to accept `chartData` prop and default to empty data, added a watcher for debugging.
  - Updated backend router `backend/app/routers/data.py` to return the full processed OHLCV data under the `data` key.

### Action: Commit Task 3.3 Changes to GitHub
- **Result:** Committed `frontend/src/components/PriceDataUploader.vue`, `frontend/vue.config.js`, `frontend/src/App.vue`, `frontend/src/components/TradingChart.vue`, `backend/app/routers/data.py`, `docs/project_guidelines/TASKS.md`, `docs/project_guidelines/DIARY.md`, `docs/project_guidelines/CHANGELOG.md`, and `VERSION_COUNTER.txt` to the `main` branch of `tarasenkofedor/inchart-v0-inginition`. Commit SHA: `d40aa2d3990291c1759d728e953c2bf3c14e767e`.

### Action: Resolve 401 Unauthorized for Unauthenticated Price Data Upload (Architectural Change)
- **Result:** Implemented an anonymous session token strategy to ensure all API requests (including unauthenticated ones for price upload) carry a JWT. This involves:
    - Adding a rule to `CRITICAL_RULES.md` for logging MVP compromises.
    - Logging previous failed attempts to fix the 401 in `ERROR_LOG.md`.
    - **Architectural Note (MVP Compromise & Scalability):** The introduction of anonymous session tokens is a robust MVP approach. It allows unauthenticated users to use features like price data upload, while maintaining a consistent token-based authentication flow for all backend requests. This is more scalable than making individual endpoints optionally authenticated, as it simplifies endpoint security logic and provides a clear path to associating anonymous sessions with registered user accounts later. The ideal long-term solution might involve more granular permissions or roles, but anonymous tokens provide a good balance for MVP speed and future extensibility.
    - *Further implementation steps for anonymous tokens (backend endpoint, Vuex changes) will be logged as they are completed.*

### Action: Resolve Chart Data Display Issue (Prop Type Mismatch & Data Structure)
- **Result:** Successfully resolved the issue where uploaded price data was not displaying on the chart, despite a success message. The root causes were:
    1.  **Initial Prop Type Mismatch:** `TradingChart.vue` and `TradingVue` expected an `Object` for their main data prop (`chartData` and `data` respectively), but `App.vue` was initializing `ohlcvData` as an `Array` (`[]`). This caused warnings on initial page load.
    2.  **Post-Upload Prop Type Mismatch:** Even after data transformation in `App.vue`, `ohlcvData` (an array of arrays for OHLCV) was being passed directly as a prop, still violating the expectation of an `Object`.
- **Fixes Implemented:**
    - **`frontend/src/components/TradingChart.vue`:** Confirmed its `chartData` prop correctly expected an `Object` and had a suitable default structure.
    - **`frontend/src/App.vue`:**
        - Modified `data.ohlcvData` to initialize as an `Object` conforming to the `trading-vue-js` data structure: `{ chart: { type: 'Candles', data: [] } }`.
        - Updated `handlePriceDataUploaded` method to populate `this.ohlcvData.chart.data` with the transformed array of OHLCV data points.
        - Ensured reactivity by reassigning `this.ohlcvData = { ...this.ohlcvData };` after the nested update.
- **Outcome:** Prop type warnings are resolved. Uploaded price data is now correctly displayed on the chart. Anonymous data upload functionality is confirmed working end-to-end.

## 2025-05-19 (Current Date)

### Action: Implement User Login UI and Basic Flow (Task 3.5.1)
- **Result:** Completed the initial implementation of the user login interface and routing.
    - Created `frontend/src/components/Login.vue` with a form for email and password, dispatching a Vuex `login` action.
    - Created `frontend/src/components/MainChartPage.vue` and moved the existing chart and uploader layout into it from `App.vue`.
    - Updated `frontend/src/router/index.js`:
        - Added routes for `/login` (LoginComponent) and `/` (MainChartPageComponent).
        - Implemented a navigation guard to redirect unauthenticated users from `/` to `/login`, and authenticated users from `/login` to `/`.
    - Updated `frontend/src/App.vue`:
        - Replaced main content with `<router-view/>`.
        - Added a navigation bar with a "Home" link.
        - Displays "Login" link or "Welcome, {user.email}! [Logout Button]" based on Vuex `isAuthenticated` state.
        - Logout button dispatches Vuex `logout` action and redirects to `/login`.
        - `autoLogin` action is called on `created()` hook.
    - Updated `frontend/src/components/Login.vue` to redirect to the intended page (or `/`) after successful login and to include a link to a future registration page.
- **Next:** Proceed with Task 3.5.2 (Registration Component Integration).

### Action: Start Registration Component (Task 3.5.2)
- **Result:** Began implementation of the user registration component.
    - Created `frontend/src/components/Register.vue` with a form for email, password, and confirm password.
    - Added client-side validation for password matching.
    - Implemented logic to call the `/api/auth/register` backend endpoint using `axios`.
    - Included basic error handling and success message display, with a timed redirect to login upon successful registration.
    - Added a route for `/register` in `frontend/src/router/index.js` and marked it as a `guest` route.
    - Updated the navigation guard in `frontend/src/router/index.js` to prevent authenticated users from accessing `guest` routes (like `/login` and `/register`), redirecting them to the main chart page (`/`).
- **Next:** Commit changes and consider further refinements for registration or move to Task 3.5.3.

### Action: Refine Registration Component - Task Breakdown (Task 3.5.2.1 - 3.5.2.3)
- **Result:** Updated `docs/project_guidelines/TASKS.md` to break down Task 3.5.2 (Registration Component Integration) into more specific sub-tasks:
    - 3.5.2 (original): Marked as `done` (covering basic UI and direct API call).
    - 3.5.2.1: `pending` - Create Vuex action for registration.
    - 3.5.2.2: `pending` - Implement auto-login after successful registration.
    - 3.5.2.3: `pending` - Enhance error handling and user feedback in Register component.
- **Next:** Implement Vuex action for registration (Task 3.5.2.1).

### Action: Implement Vuex Registration Action (Task 3.5.2.1)
- **Result:** Added a `register` action to `frontend/src/store/index.js`. This action calls the `/api/auth/register` endpoint.
- **Status:** Task 3.5.2.1 marked as `done` in `TASKS.md`.

### Action: Implement Auto-Login Post-Registration (Task 3.5.2.2)
- **Result:** Modified `frontend/src/components/Register.vue` to:
    - Use the new `register` Vuex action.
    - Dispatch the `login` Vuex action upon successful registration.
    - Redirect to the main application page (`/`) after successful auto-login.
- **Status:** Task 3.5.2.2 marked as `done` in `TASKS.md`.

### Action: Review Registration Error Handling (Task 3.5.2.3)
- **Result:** Reviewed error handling in `frontend/src/components/Register.vue`. Confirmed that errors from Vuex actions (which propagate backend errors) are displayed. Considered current setup sufficient for MVP.
- **Status:** Task 3.5.2.3 marked as `done` in `TASKS.md`.
- **Next:** Update documentation (CHANGELOG, VERSION_COUNTER) and commit changes. Then proceed to Task 3.5.3 (Display User State / Logout Button).

### Action: Update Project Context Summary in DIARY.md (Post-Nickname & Pre-Alembic)
- **Result:** Updated the "Project Context Summary" at the beginning of `DIARY.md` to reflect the completion of nickname integration (Tasks 3.5.4 - 3.5.8), the issues encountered with the database schema, and the plan to introduce Alembic (Tasks 1.6.1 - 1.6.5).

### Action: Update `docs/project_guidelines/TECH_STACK.md` for Alembic
- **Result:** Added "Alembic" under "Database Migration Tool" in the Backend section of `docs/project_guidelines/TECH_STACK.md`.

### Action: Create `python_packaging.mdc` Rule
- **Result:** Created a new rule file `.cursor/rules/python_packaging.mdc` specifying that Python backend dependencies must be listed in `backend/requirements.txt` and installed/managed using the virtual environment's `pip`.

### Action: Update `CRITICAL_RULES.md` for `.env` file
- **Result:** Added a "Credentials Management (`.env`)" section to `docs/project_guidelines/CRITICAL_RULES.md`, mandating the use of a root `.env` file for all project credentials and secrets.

### Action: Add Alembic Setup Tasks to `TASKS.md`
- **Result:** Added new sub-tasks 1.6.1 through 1.6.5 under a new parent task "1.6 Database Migrations with Alembic" in `docs/project_guidelines/TASKS.md`.

### Action: Install Alembic (Task 1.6.1)
- **Result:** Added `alembic` to `backend/requirements.txt`. Ran `../.venv/bin/pip install -r backend/requirements.txt` from the `backend/` directory. Task 1.6.1 marked as `done`.

### Action: Initialize Alembic (Task 1.6.2)
- **Result:** Deleted existing `backend/alembic/` directory and `backend/alembic.ini` file. Successfully ran `../.venv/bin/alembic init alembic` from within the `backend/` directory. Task 1.6.2 marked as `done`.

### Action: Configure Alembic (Task 1.6.3)
- **Result:**
    - Modified `backend/alembic.ini` to set `sqlalchemy.url = PLACEHOLDER_WILL_BE_SET_BY_ENV_PY`.
    - Modified `backend/alembic/env.py` to:
        - Adjust `sys.path` to allow imports from the `app` directory.
        - Import `Base` from `backend.app.models`.
        - Import `settings` from `backend.app.config`.
        - Set `target_metadata = Base.metadata`.
        - Configure `run_migrations_offline()` and `run_migrations_online()` to use `settings.DATABASE_URL`.
- Task 1.6.3 marked as `done`.

### Action: Generate Initial Migration (Task 1.6.4) - User Action
- **Result:** User (Fyodor) confirmed they generated the migration `backend/alembic/versions/a39e46cc5f70_create_user_table_with_nickname.py` which includes the `users` table with the `nickname` column. Task 1.6.4 is considered `done` due to user action.

### Action: Apply Initial Migration (Task 1.6.5) - User Action & AI Follow-up
- **Result:** User (Fyodor) dropped the existing `users` table. AI then successfully ran `../.venv/bin/alembic upgrade head` from the `backend/` directory. The initial migration `a39e46cc5f70_create_user_table_with_nickname.py` was applied, creating the `users` table with the correct schema including the `nickname` column. Task 1.6.5 marked as `done`.

### Action: Update Project Context Summary in DIARY.md (Post-Alembic Integration)
- **Result:** The Project Context Summary at the beginning of `DIARY.md` has been updated to reflect the successful integration of Alembic for database migrations. The initial migration for the `users` table (including the `nickname` column) has been applied. The database schema is now aligned with the application models.
